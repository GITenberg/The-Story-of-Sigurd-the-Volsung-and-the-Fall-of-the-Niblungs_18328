SIGURD THE VOLSUNG
AND THE
FALL OF THE NIBLUNGS.</h1>

<h2>BOOK I.</h2>

<h3>SIGMUND.</h3>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">in this book is told of the earlier days of the volsungs, and of
sigmund the father of sigurd, and of his deeds, and of how
he died while sigurd was yet unborn in his mother's womb.</span></p></div>


<h4>Of the dwelling of King Volsung, and the wedding of Signy his daughter.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was a dwelling of Kings ere the world was waxen old;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dukes were the door-wards there, and the roofs were thatched with gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earls were the wrights that wrought it, and silver nailed its doors;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earls' wives were the weaving-women, queens' daughters strewed its floors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the masters of its song-craft were the mightiest men that cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sails of the storm of battle adown the bickering blast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There dwelt men merry-hearted, and in hope exceeding great<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Met the good days and the evil as they went the way of fate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the Gods were unforgotten, yea whiles they walked with men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though e'en in that world's beginning rose a murmur now and again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the midward time and the fading and the last of the latter days,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span><span class="i0">And the entering in of the terror, and the death of the People's Praise.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus was the dwelling of Volsung, the King of the Midworld's Mark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a rose in the winter season, a candle in the dark;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as in all other matters 'twas all earthly houses' crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the least of its wall-hung shields was a battle-world's renown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So therein withal was a marvel and a glorious thing to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For amidst of its midmost hall-floor sprang up a mighty tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That reared its blessings roofward, and wreathed the roof-tree dear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the glory of the summer and the garland of the year.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not how they called it ere Volsung changed his life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his dawning of fair promise, and his noontide of the strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eve of the battle-reaping and the garnering of his fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have bred us many a story and named us many a name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when men tell of Volsung, they call that war-duke's tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That crown&egrave;d stem, the Branstock; and so was it told unto me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So there was the throne of Volsung beneath its blossoming bower.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But high o'er the roof-crest red it rose 'twixt tower and tower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therein were the wild hawks dwelling, abiding the dole of their lord;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they wailed high over the wine, and laughed to the waking sword.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still were its boughs but for them, when lo on an even of May<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes a man from Siggeir the King with a word for his mouth to say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"All hail to thee King Volsung, from the King of the Goths I come:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hath heard of thy sword victorious and thine abundant home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hath heard of thy sons in the battle, the fillers of Odin's Hall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a word hath the west-wind blown him, (full fruitful be its fall!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A word of thy daughter Signy the crown of womanhood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now he deems thy friendship goodly, and thine help in the battle good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for these will he give his friendship and his battle-aid again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if thou wouldst grant his asking, and make his heart full fain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shalt thou give him a matter, saith he, without a price,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span><span class="i0">&mdash;Signy the fairer than fair, Signy the wiser than wise."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Such words in the hall of the Volsungs spake the Earl of Siggeir the Goth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing the gifts and the gold, the ring, and the tokens of troth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the King's heart laughed within him and the King's sons deemed it good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they dreamed how they fared with the Goths o'er ocean and acre and wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till all the north was theirs, and the utmost southern lands.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But nought said the snow-white Signy as she sat with folded hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gazed at the Goth-king's Earl till his heart grew heavy and cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one that half remembers a tale that the elders have told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A story of weird and of woe: then spake King Volsung and said:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A great king woos thee, daughter; wilt thou lie in a great king's bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bear earth's kings on thy bosom, that our name may never die?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A fire lit up her face, and her voice was e'en as a cry:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I will sleep in a great king's bed, I will bear the lords of the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wrack and the grief of my youth-days shall be held for nothing worth."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then would he question her kindly, as one who loved her sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she put forth her hand and smiled, and her face was flushed no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Would God it might otherwise be! but wert thou to will it not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet should I will it and wed him, and rue my life and my lot."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lowly and soft she said it; but spake out louder now:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Be of good cheer, King Volsung! for such a man art thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That what thou dost well-counselled, goodly and fair it is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what thou dost unwitting, the Gods have bidden thee this:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So work all things together for the fame of thee and thine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now meseems at my wedding shall be a hallowed sign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shall give thine heart a joyance, whatever shall follow after."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span><span class="i0">She spake, and the feast sped on, and the speech and the song and the laughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went over the words of boding as the tide of the norland main<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweeps over the hidden skerry, the home of the shipman's bane.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So wendeth his way on the morrow that Earl of the Gothland King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing the gifts and the gold, and King Volsung's tokening,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a word in his mouth moreover, a word of blessing and hail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a bidding to King Siggeir to come ere the June-tide fail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wed him to white-hand Signy and bear away his bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While sleepeth the field of the fishes amidst the summer-tide.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So on Mid-Summer Even ere the undark night began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Siggeir the King of the Goth-folk went up from the bath of the swan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto the Volsung dwelling with many an Earl about;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There through the glimmering thicket the link&egrave;d mail rang out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sang as mid the woodways sings the summer-hidden ford:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were gold-rings God-fashioned, and many a Dwarf-wrought sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a Queen-wrought kirtle and many a written spear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So came they to the acres, and drew the threshold near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And amidst of the garden blossoms, on the grassy, fruit-grown land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was Volsung the King of the Wood-world with his sons on either hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therewith down lighted Siggeir the lord of a mighty folk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet showed he by King Volsung as the bramble by the oak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor reached his helm to the shoulder of the least of Volsung's sons.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so into the hall they wended, the Kings and their mighty ones;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they dight the feast full glorious, and drank through the death of the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the shadowless moon rose upward, till it wended white away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they went to the gold-hung beds, and at last for an hour or twain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were all things still and silent, save a flaw of the summer rain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But on the morrow noontide when the sun was high and bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More glorious was the banquet, and now was Signy there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she sat beside King Siggeir, a glorious bride forsooth;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span><span class="i0">Ruddy and white was she wrought as the fair-stained sea-beast's tooth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she neither laughed nor spake, and her eyes were hard and cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with wandering side-long looks her lord would she behold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That saw Sigmund her brother, the eldest Volsung son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft he looked upon her, and their eyes met now and anon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ruth arose in his heart, and hate of Siggeir the Goth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there had he broken the wedding, but for plighted promise and troth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But those twain were beheld of Siggeir, and he deemed of the Volsung kin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That amid their might and their malice small honour should he win;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet thereof made he no semblance, but abided times to be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laughed out with the loudest, amid the hope and the glee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nought of all saw Volsung, as he dreamed of the coming glory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how the Kings of his kindred should fashion the round world's story.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So round about the Branstock they feast in the gleam of the gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though the deeds of man-folk were not yet waxen old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet had they tales for songcraft, and the blossomed garth of rhyme;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tales of the framing of all things and the entering in of time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the halls of the outer heaven; so near they knew the door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherefore uprose a sea-king, and his hands that loved the oar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now dealt with the rippling harp-gold, and he sang of the shaping of earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how the stars were lighted, and where the winds had birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gleam of the first of summers on the yet untrodden grass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But e'en as men's hearts were hearkening some heard the thunder pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the cloudless noontide heaven; and some men turned about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deemed that in the doorway they heard a man laugh out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then into the Volsung dwelling a mighty man there strode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One-eyed and seeming ancient, yet bright his visage glowed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cloud-blue was the hood upon him, and his kirtle gleaming-grey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the latter morning sundog when the storm is on the way:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bill he bore on his shoulder, whose mighty ashen beam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burnt bright with the flame of the sea and the blended silver's gleam.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such was the guise of his raiment as the Volsung elders had told<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span><span class="i0">Was borne by their fathers' fathers, and the first that warred in the wold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So strode he to the Branstock nor greeted any lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But forth from his cloudy raiment he drew a gleaming sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smote it deep in the tree-bole, and the wild hawks overhead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughed 'neath the naked heaven as at last he spake and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Earls of the Goths, and Volsungs, abiders on the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo there amid the Branstock a blade of plenteous worth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The folk of the war-wand's forgers wrought never better steel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since first the burg of heaven uprose for man-folk's weal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now let the man among you whose heart and hand may shift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pluck it from the oakwood e'en take it for my gift.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then ne'er, but his own heart falter, its point and edge shall fail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the night's beginning and the ending of the tale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be merry Earls of the Goth-folk, O Volsung Sons be wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reap the battle-acre that ripening for you lies:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they told me in the wild wood, I heard on the mountain side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the shining house of heaven is wrought exceeding wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that there the Early-comers shall have abundant rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Earth grows scant of great ones, and fadeth from its best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fadeth from its midward and groweth poor and vile:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All hail to thee King Volsung! farewell for a little while!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So sweet his speaking sounded, so wise his words did seem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That moveless all men sat there, as in a happy dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We stir not lest we waken; but there his speech had end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slowly down the hall-floor, and outward did he wend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none would cast him a question or follow on his ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they knew that the gift was Odin's, a sword for the world to praise.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But now spake Volsung the King: "Why sit ye silent and still?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the Battle-Father's visage a token of terror and ill?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arise O Volsung Children, Earls of the Goths arise,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span><span class="i0">And set your hands to the hilts as mighty men and wise!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet deem it not too easy; for belike a fateful blade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies there in the heart of the Branstock for a fated warrior made."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now therewith spake King Siggeir: "King Volsung give me a grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To try it the first of all men, lest another win my place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mere chance-hap steal my glory and the gain that I might win."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then somewhat laughed King Volsung, and he said: "O Guest, begin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though herein is the first as the last, for the Gods have long to live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor hath Odin yet forgotten unto whom the gift he would give."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then forth to the tree went Siggeir, the Goth-folk's mighty lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laid his hand on the gemstones, and strained at the glorious sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till his heart grew black with anger; and never a word he said<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he wended back to the high-seat: but Signy waxed blood-red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he sat him adown beside her; and her heart was nigh to break<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the shame and the fateful boding: and therewith King Volsung spake:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thus comes back empty-handed the mightiest King of Earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how shall the feeble venture? yet each man knows his worth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And today may a great beginning from a little seed upspring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To o'erpass many a great one that hath the name of King:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So stand forth free and unfree; stand forth both most and least:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But first ye Earls of the Goth-folk, ye lovely lords we feast."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Upstood the Earls of Siggeir, and each man drew anigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deemed his time was coming for a glorious gain and high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for all their mighty shaping and their deeds in the battle-wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No looser in the Branstock that gift of Odin stood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then uprose Volsung's homemen, and the fell-abiding folk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the yellow-headed shepherds came gathering round the Oak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the searchers of the thicket and the dealers with the oar:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><span class="i0">And the least and the worst of them all was a mighty man of war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for all their mighty shaping, and the struggle and the strain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of their hands, the deft in labour, they tugged thereat in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still as the shouting and jeers, and the names of men and the laughter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beat backward from gable to gable, and rattled o'er roof-tree and rafter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moody and still sat Siggeir; for he said: "They have trained me here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a mock for their woodland bondsmen; and yet shall they buy it dear."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the tumult sank a little, and men cried on Volsung the King<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his sons, the hedge of battle, to try the fateful thing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Volsung laughed, and answered: "I will set me to the toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest these my guests of the Goth-folk should deem I fear the foil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet nought am I ill-sworded, and the oldest friend is best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this, my hand's first fellow, will I bear to the grave-mound's rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wield meanwhile another: Yea this shall I have in hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When mid the host of Odin in the Day of Doom I stand."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Therewith from his belt of battle he raised the golden sheath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And showed the peace-strings glittering about the hidden death:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he laid his hand on the Branstock, and cried: "O tree beloved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thank thee of thy good-heart that so little thou art moved:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abide thou thus, green bower, when I am dead and gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the best of all my kindred a better day hath won!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then as a young man laughed he, and on the hilts of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hand, the battle-breaker, took fast and certain hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long he drew and strained him, but mended not the tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet none the more thereover his mirth of heart did fail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he wended to the high-seat and thence began to cry:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sons I have gotten and cherished, now stand ye forth to try;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest Odin tell in God-home how from the way he strayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how to the man he would not he gave away his blade."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span><span class="i0">So therewithal rose Rerir, and wasted might and main;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Gunthiof, and then Hunthiof, they wearied them in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nought was the might of Agnar; nought Helgi could avail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sigi the tall and Solar no further brought the tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor Geirmund the priest of the temple, nor Gylfi of the wood.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last by the side of the Branstock Sigmund the Volsung stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with right hand wise in battle the precious sword-hilt caught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet in a careless fashion, as he deemed it all for nought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When lo, from floor to rafter went up a shattering shout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For aloft in the hand of Sigmund the naked blade shone out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As high o'er his head he shook it: for the sword had come away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the grip of the heart of the Branstock, as though all loose it lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little while he stood there mid the glory of the hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the best of the trees of the garden, when the April sunbeams fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On its blossomed boughs in the morning, and tell of the days to be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then back unto the high-seat he wended soberly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this was the thought within him; Belike the day shall come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I shall bide here lonely amid the Volsung home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its glory and sole avenger, its after-summer seed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, I am the hired of Odin, his workday will to speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the harvest-tide shall be heavy.&mdash;What then, were it come and past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I laid by the last of the sheaves with my wages earned at the last?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He lifted his eyes as he thought it, for now was he come to his place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there he stood by his father and met Siggeir face to face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he saw him blithe and smiling, and heard him how he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O best of the sons of Volsung, I am merry for thy sake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the glory that thou hast gained us; but whereas thine hand and heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are e'en now the lords of the battle, how lack'st thou for thy part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A matter to better the best? Wilt thou overgild fine gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dye the red rose redder? So I prithee let me hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This sword that comes to thine hand on the day I wed thy kin.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span><span class="i0">For at home have I a store-house; there is mountain-gold therein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weight of a war-king's harness; there is silver plenteous store;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is iron, and huge-wrought amber, that the southern men love sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they sell me the woven wonder, the purple born of the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it hangeth up in that bower; and all this is a gift for thee:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the sword that came to my wedding, methinketh it meet and right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That it lie on my knees in the council and stead me in the fight."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Sigmund laughed and answered, and he spake a scornful word:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And if I take twice that treasure, will it buy me Odin's sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gift that the Gods have given? will it buy me again to stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt two mightiest world-kings with a longed-for thing in mine hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all their might hath missed of? when the purple-selling men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come buying thine iron and amber, dost thou sell thine honour then?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do they wrap it in bast of the linden, or run it in moulds of earth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shalt thou account mine honour as a matter of lesser worth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came the sword to thy wedding, Goth-king, to thine hand it never came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thence is thine envy whetted to deal me this word of shame."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Black then was the heart of Siggeir, but his face grew pale and red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he drew a smile thereover, and spake the word and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nay, pardon me, Signy's kinsman! when the heart desires o'ermuch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It teacheth the tongue ill speaking, and my word belike was such.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the honour of thee and thy kindred, I hold it even as mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I love you as my heart-blood, and take ye this for a sign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bid thee now King Volsung, and these thy glorious sons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thine earls and thy dukes of battle and all thy mighty ones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To come to the house of the Goth-kings as honoured guests and dear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And abide the winter over; that the dusky days and drear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May be glorious with thy presence, that all folk may praise my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the friends that my fame hath gotten; and that this my new-wed wife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine eyes may make the merrier till she bear my eldest born."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span><span class="i0">Then speedily answered Volsung: "No king of the earth might scorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such noble bidding, Siggeir; and surely will I come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To look upon thy glory and the Goths' abundant home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let two months wear over, for I have many a thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shape and shear in the Woodland, as befits a people's king:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou meanwhile here abiding of all my goods shalt be free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then shall we twain together roof over the glass-green sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the sides of our golden dragons; and our war-hosts' blended shields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall fright the sea-abiders and the folk of the fishy fields."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Answered the smooth-speeched Siggeir: "I thank thee well for this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy bidding is most kingly; yet take it not amiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I wend my ways in the morning; for we Goth-folk know indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the sea is a foe full deadly, and a friend that fails at need,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that Ran who dwells thereunder will many a man beguile:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I bear a woman with me; nor would I for a while<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold that sea-queen's dwelling; for glad at heart am I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the realm of the Goths and the Volsungs, and I look for long to lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the arms of the fairest woman that ever a king may kiss.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I go mine house to order for the increase of thy bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That there in nought but joyance all we may wear the days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that men of the time hereafter the more our lives may praise."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And for all the words of Volsung e'en so must the matter be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Siggeir the Goth and Signy on the morn shall sail the sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the feast sped on the fairer, and the more they waxed in disport<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the glee that all men love, as they knew that the hours were short.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet a boding heart bare Sigmund amid his singing and laughter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And somewhat Signy wotted of the deeds that were coming after;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the wisest of women she was, and many a thing she knew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She would hearken the voice of the midnight till she heard what the Gods would do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her feet fared oft on the wild, and deep was her communing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the heart of the glimmering woodland, where never a fowl may sing.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So fair sped on the feasting amid the gleam of the gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the wine and the joyance; and many a tale was told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the harp-strings of that wedding, whereof the latter days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet hold a little glimmer to wonder at and praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the undark night drew over, and faint the high stars shone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there on the beds blue-woven the slumber-tide they won;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea while on the brightening mountain the herd-boy watched his sheep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet soft on the breast of Signy King Siggeir lay asleep.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>How the Volsungs fared to the Land of the Goths, and of the
fall of King Volsung.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now or ever the sun shone houseward, unto King Volsung's bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came Signy stealing barefoot, and she spake the word and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Awake and hearken, my father, for though the wedding be done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I am the wife of the Goth-king, yet the Volsungs are not gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I come as a dream of the night, with a word that the Gods would say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And think thou thereof in the day-tide, and let Siggeir go on his way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With me and the gifts and the gold, but do ye abide in the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor trust in the guileful heart and the murder-loving hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest the kin of the Volsungs perish, and the world be nothing worth."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So came the word unto Volsung, and wit in his heart had birth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he sat upright in the bed and kissed her on the lips;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he said: "My word is given, it is gone like the spring-tide ships:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To death or to life must I journey when the months are come to an end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet my sons my words shall hearken, and shall nowise with me wend."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she answered, speaking swiftly: "Nay, have thy sons with thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gather an host together and a mighty company,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And meet the guile and the death-snare with battle and with wrack."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He said: "Nay, my troth-word plighted e'en so should I draw aback:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall go a guest, as my word was; of whom shall I be afraid?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For an outworn elder's ending shall no mighty moan be made."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then answered Signy, weeping: "I shall see thee yet again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the battle thou arrayest on the Goth-folks' strand in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavy and hard are the Norns: but each man his burden bears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what am I to fashion the fate of the coming years?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She wept and she wended back to the Goth-king's bolster blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Volsung pondered awhile till slumber over him drew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when once more he wakened, the kingly house was up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the homemen gathered together to drink the parting cup:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grand amid the hall-floor was the Goth king in his gear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Signy clad for faring stood by the Branstock dear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the earls of the Goths about her: so queenly did she seem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So calm and ruddy coloured, that Volsung well might deem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That her words were a fashion of slumber, a vision of the night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they drank the wine of departing, and brought the horses dight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forth abroad the Goth-folk and the Volsung Children rode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever once would Signy look back to that abode.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So down over acre and heath they rode to the side of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there by the long-ships' bridges was the ship-host's company.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Signy kissed her brethren with ruddy mouth and warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor was there one of the Goth-folk but blessed her from all harm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sweet she kissed her father and hung about his neck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sure she whispered him somewhat ere she passed forth toward the deck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though nought I know to tell it: then Siggeir hailed them fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called forth many a blessing on the hearts that bode his snare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then were the gangways shipped, and blown was the parting horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the striped sails drew with the wind, and away was Signy borne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White on the shielded long-ship, a grief in the heart of the gold;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span><span class="i0">Nor once would she turn her about the strand of her folk to behold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thenceforward dwelt the Volsungs in exceeding glorious state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And merry lived King Volsung, abiding the day of his fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the months aforesaid were well-nigh worn away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his sons and his folk of counsel he fell these words to say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ye mind you of Signy's wedding and of my plighted troth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To go in two months' wearing to the house of Siggeir the Goth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor will I hide how Signy then spake a warning word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And did me to wit that her husband was a grim and guileful lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would draw us to our undoing for envy and despite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Concerning the Sword of Odin, and for dread of the Volsung might.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now wise is Signy my daughter and knoweth nought but sooth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet are there seasons and times when for longing and self-ruth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hearts of women wander, and this maybe is such;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor for her word of Siggeir will I trow it overmuch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor altogether doubt it, since the woman is wrought so wise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor much might my heart love Siggeir for all his kingly guise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, shall a king hear murder when a king's mouth blessing saith?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So maybe he is bidding me honour, and maybe he is bidding me death:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him do after his fashion, and I will do no less.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In peace will I go to his bidding let the spae-wrights ban or bless;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no man now or hereafter of Volsung's blenching shall tell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ye, sons, in the land shall tarry, and heed the realm right well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest the Volsung Children fade, and the wide world worser grow."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But with one voice cried all men, that they one and all would go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gather the Goth-king's honour, or let one fate go over all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he bade them to battle and murder, till each by each should fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So spake the sons of his body, and the wise in wisdom and war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet might it otherwise be, though Volsung bade full sore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he go in some ship of the merchants with his life alone in his hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such love he loved his kindred, and the people of his land.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span><span class="i0">But at last he said:<br /></span>
<span class="i8">"So be it; for in vain I war with fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who can raise up a king from the dunghill and make the feeble great.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the Gods, mine own forefathers, shall take counsel of our home."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So now, when all things were ready, in the first of the autumn tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adown unto the swan-bath the Volsung Children ride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lightly go a shipboard, a goodly company,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the tale thereof be scanty and their ships no more than three:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But kings' sons dealt with the sail-sheets and earls and dukes of war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were the halers of the hawsers and the tuggers at the oar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they drew the bridges shipward, and left the land behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair astern of the longships sprang up a following wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So swift o'er &AElig;gir's acre those mighty sailors ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And speedier than all other ploughed down the furrows wan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they came to the land of the Goth-folk on the even of a day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo by the inmost skerry a skiff with a sail of grey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That as they neared the foreshore ran Volsung's ship aboard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there was come white-hand Signy with her latest warning word.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O strange," she said, "meseemeth, O sweet, your gear to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the well-loved Volsung faces, and the hands that cherished me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But short is the time that is left me for the work I have to win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though nought it be but the speaking of a word ere the worst begin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that which I spake aforetime, the seed of a boding drear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It hath sprung, it hath blossomed and born rank harvest of the spear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Siggeir hath dight the death-snare; he hath spread the shielded net.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ye come ere the hour appointed, and he looks not to meet you yet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now blest be the wind that wafted your sails here over-soon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thus have I won me seaward 'twixt the twilight and the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pray you for all the world's sake turn back from the murderous shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Ah take me hence, my father, to see my land once more!"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then sweetly Volsung kissed her: "Woe am I for thy sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But earth the word hath hearkened, that yet unborn I spake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How I ne'er would turn me backward from the sword or the fire of bale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;I have held that word till today, and today shall I change the tale?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And look on these thy brethren, how goodly and great are they,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wouldst thou have the maidens mock them, when this pain hath past away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they sit at the feast hereafter, that they feared the deadly stroke?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us do our day's work deftly for the praise and the glory of folk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if the Norns will have it that the Volsung kin shall fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I know of the deed that dies not, and the name that shall ever avail."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But she wept as one sick-hearted: "Woe's me for the hope of the morn!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet send me not back unto Siggeir and the evil days and the scorn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me bide the death as ye bide it, and let a woman feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hope of the death of battle and the rest of the foeman's steel."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nay nay," he said, "go backward: this too thy fate will have;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thou art the wife of a king, and many a matter may'st save.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell! as the days win over, as sweet as a tale shall it grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This day when our hearts were hardened; and our glory thou shalt know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the love wherewith we loved thee mid the battle and the wrack."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She kissed them and departed, and mid the dusk fared back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she sat that eve in the high-seat; and I deem that Siggeir knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The way that her feet had wended, and the deed she went to do:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the man was grim and guileful, and he knew that the snare was laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the mountain bull unblenching and the lion unafraid.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But when the sun on the morrow shone over earth and sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ashore went the Volsung Children a goodly company,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And toward King Siggeir's dwelling o'er heath and holt they went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when they came to the topmost of a certain grassy bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo there lay the land before them as thick with shield and spear<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span><span class="i0">As the rich man's wealthiest acre with the harvest of the year.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There bade King Volsung tarry and dight the wedge-array;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For duly," he said, "doeth Siggeir to meet his guests by the way."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shield by shield they serried, nor ever hath been told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of any host of battle more glorious with the gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there stood the high King Volsung in the very front of war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lovelier was his visage than ever heretofore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he rent apart the peace-strings that his brand of battle bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bright blade gleamed to the heavens, and he cast the sheath to the ground.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then up the steep came the Goth-folk, and the spear-wood drew anigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And earth's face shook beneath them, yet cried they never a cry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Volsungs stood all silent, although forsooth at whiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the faces grown earth-weary would play the flickering smiles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swords would clink and rattle: not long had they to bide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For soon that flood of murder flowed round the hillock-side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then at last the edges mingled, and if men forebore the shout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the din of steel and iron in the grey clouds rang about;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But how to tell of King Volsung, and the valour of his folk!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three times the wood of battle before their edges broke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the shield-wall, sorely dwindled and reft of the ruddy gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the drift of the war-blast for the fourth time yet did hold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But men's shields were waxen heavy with the weight of shafts they bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fifth time many a champion cast earthward Odin's door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gripped the sword two-handed; and in sheaves the spears came on.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at last the host of the Goth-folk within the shield-wall won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wild was the work within it, and oft and o'er again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth brake the sons of Volsung, and drave the foe in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the driven throng still thickened, till it might not give aback.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fast abode King Volsung amid the shifting wrack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the place where once was the forefront: for he said: "My feet are old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if I wend on further there is nought more to behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than this that I see about me."&mdash;Whiles drew his foes away<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span><span class="i0">And stared across the corpses that before his sword-edge lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nought he followed after: then needs must they in front<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrust on by the thickening spear-throng come up to bear the brunt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till all his limbs were weary and his body rent and torn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he cried: "Lo now, Allfather, is not the swathe well shorn?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wouldst thou have me toil for ever, nor win the wages due?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And mid the hedge of foemen his blunted sword he threw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, laid like the oars of a longship the level war-shafts pressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On 'gainst the unshielded elder, and clashed amidst his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dead he fell, thrust backward, and rang on the dead men's gear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still for a certain season durst no man draw anear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For 'twas e'en as a great God's slaying, and they feared the wrath of the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they deemed their hearts might harden if awhile they should let him lie.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lo, now as the plotting was long, so short is the tale to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How a mighty people's leaders in the field of murder fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For but feebly burned the battle when Volsung fell to field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all who yet were living were borne down before the shield:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sinketh the din and the tumult; and the earls of the Goths ring round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That crown of the Kings of battle laid low upon the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking up to the noon-tide heavens from the place where first he stood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the songful sing above him and they tell how his end is as good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the best of the days of his life-tide; and well as he was loved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By his friends ere the time of his changing, so now are his foemen moved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a love that may never be worsened, since all the strife is o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the warders look for his coming by Odin's open door.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But his sons, the stay of battle, alive with many a wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne down to the earth by the shield-rush amid the dead lie bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And belike a wearier journey must those lords of battle bide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere once more in the Hall of Odin they sit by their father's side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woe's me for the boughs of the Branstock and the hawks that cried on the fight!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Woe's me for the carven pillars where the spears of the Volsungs stood!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who next shall shake the locks, or the silver door-rings meet?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shall pace the floor beloved, worn down by the Volsung feet?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shall fill the gold with the wine, or cry for the triumphing?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall it be kindred or foes, or thief, or thrall, or king?<br /></span>

<h4>Of the ending of all Volsung's Sons save Sigmund only, and of how he
abideth in the wild wood.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So there the earls of the Goth-folk lay Volsung 'neath the grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the last earth he had trodden; but his children bound must pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the host is gathered together, amidst of their array<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the high-built dwelling of Siggeir; for sooth it is to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he came not into the battle, nor faced the Volsung sword.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So now as he sat in his high-seat there came his chiefest lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he said: "I bear thee tidings of the death of the best of the brave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thy foes are slain or bondsmen; and have thou Sigmund's glaive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If a token thou desirest; and that shall be surely enough.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I do thee to wit, King Siggeir, that the road was exceeding rough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that many an earl there stumbled, who shall evermore lie down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And indeed I deem King Volsung for all earthly kingship's crown."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then never a word spake Siggeir, save: "Where be Volsung's sons?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he said: "Without are they fettered, those battle-glorious ones:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And methinks 'twere a deed for a king, and a noble deed for thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To break their bonds and heal them, and send them back o'er the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And abide their wrath and the bloodfeud for this matter of Volsung's slaying:"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Witless thou waxest," said Siggeir, "nor heedest the wise man's saying;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span><span class="i0">'Slay thou the wolf by the house-door, lest he slay thee in the wood.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet since I am the overcomer, and my days henceforth shall be good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will quell them with no death-pains; let the young men smite them down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let me not behold them when my heart is angrier grown."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">E'en as he uttered the word was Signy at the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with hurrying feet she gat her apace to the high-seat floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As wan as the dawning-hour, though never a tear she had:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she cried: "I pray thee, Siggeir, now thine heart is merry and glad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the death and the bonds of my kinsmen, to grant me this one prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This one time and no other; let them breathe the earthly air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a day, for a day or twain, ere they wend the way of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For 'sweet to eye while seen,' the elders' saying saith."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth he: "Thou art mad with sorrow; wilt thou work thy friends this woe?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When swift and untormented e'en I would let them go:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet now shalt thou have thine asking, if it verily is thy will:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor forsooth do I begrudge them a longer tide of ill."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She said: "I will it, I will it&mdash;O sweet to eye while seen!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then to his earl spake Siggeir: "There lies a wood-lawn green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the first mile of the forest; there fetter these Volsung men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the mightiest beam of the wild-wood, till Queen Signy come again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pray me a boon for her brethren, the end of their latter life."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the Goth-folk led to the woodland those gleanings of the strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smote down a great-boled oak-tree, the mightiest they might find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thereto with bonds of iron the Volsungs did they bind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left them there on the wood-lawn, mid the yew-trees' compassing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And went back by the light of the moon to the dwelling of the king.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But he sent on the morn of the morrow to see how his foemen fared,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span><span class="i0">For now as he thought thereover, o'ermuch he deemed it dared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he saw not the last of the Volsungs laid dead before his feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back came his men ere the noontide, and he deemed their tidings sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they said: "We tell thee, King Siggeir, that Geirmund and Gylfi are gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we deem that a beast of the wild-wood this murder grim hath done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the bones yet lie in the fetters gnawed fleshless now and white;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we deemed the eight abiding sore minished of their might."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So wore the morn and the noontide, and the even 'gan to fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watchful eyes held Signy at home in bower and hall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And again came the men in the morning, and spake: "The hopples hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bare white bones of Helgi, and the bones of Solar the bold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the six that abide seem feebler than they were awhile ago."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still all the day and the night-tide must Signy nurse her woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the house of King Siggeir, nor any might she send:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And again came the tale on the morrow: "Now are two more come to an end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Hunthiof dead and Gunthiof, their bones lie side by side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the four that are left, us seemeth, no long while will abide."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O woe for the well-watched Signy, how often on that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must she send her helpless eyen adown the woodland way!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet silent in her bosom she held her heart of flame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And again on the morrow morning the tale was still the same:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We tell thee now, King Siggeir, that all will soon be done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the two last men of the Volsungs, they sit there one by one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sigi's head is drooping, but somewhat Sigmund sings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the man was a mighty warrior, and a beater down of kings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for Rerir and for Agnar, the last of them is said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bones in the bonds are abiding, but their souls and lives are sped."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That day from the eyes of the watchers nought Signy strove to depart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ever she sat in the high-seat and nursed the flame in her heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the sight of all people she sat, with unmoved face and wan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to no man gave she a word, nor looked on any man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the dusk and the dark drew over, but stirred she never a whit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the word of Siggeir's sending, she gave no heed to it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there on the morrow morning must he sit him down by her side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When unto the council of elders folk came from far and wide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there came Siggeir's woodmen, and their voice in the hall arose:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There is no man left on the tree-beam: some beast hath devoured thy foes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is nought left there but the bones, and the bonds that the Volsungs bound."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No word spake the earls of the Goth-folk, but the hall rang out with a sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the wail and the cry of Signy, as she stood upright on her feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrust all people from her, and fled to her bower as fleet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the hind when she first is smitten; and her maidens fled away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fearing her face and her eyen: no less at the death of the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She rose up amid the silence, and went her ways alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no man watched her or hindered, for they deemed the story done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So she went 'twixt the yellow acres, and the green meads of the sheep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And or ever she reached the wild-wood the night was waxen deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No man she had to lead her, but the path was trodden well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By those messengers of murder, the men with the tale to tell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the beams of the high white moon gave a glimmering day through night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till she came where that lawn of the woods lay wide in the flood of light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she looked, and lo, in its midmost a mighty man there stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laboured the earth of the green-sward with a truncheon torn from the wood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And behold, it was Sigmund the Volsung: but she cried and had no fear:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If thou art living, Sigmund, what day's work dost thou here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the midnight and the forest? but if thou art nought but a ghost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then where are those Volsung brethren, of whom thou wert best and most?"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he turned about unto her, and his raiment was fouled and torn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his eyen were great and hollow, as a famished man forlorn;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But he cried: "Hail, Sister Signy! I looked for thee before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though what should a woman compass, she one alone and no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all we shielded Volsungs did nought in Siggeir's land?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O yea, I am living indeed, and this labour of mine hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is to bury the bones of the Volsungs; and lo, it is well-nigh done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So draw near, Volsung's daughter, and pile we many a stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where lie the grey wolf's gleanings of what was once so good."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And when the work was over, dead night was beginning to fail:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of the death of the Volsung brethren ere the wood thy wrath shall hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere I wend me back sick-hearted in the dwelling of kings to abide."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He said: "We sat on the tree, and well ye may wot indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we had some hope from thy good-will amidst that bitter need.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now none had 'scaped the sword-edge in the battle utterly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so hurt were Agnar and Helgi, that, unhelped, they were like to die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though for that we deemed them happier: but now when the moon shone bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when by a doomed man's deeming 'twas the midmost of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, forth from yonder thicket were two mighty wood-wolves come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far huger wrought to my deeming than the beasts I knew at home:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forthright on Gylfi and Geirmund those dogs of the forest fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what of men so hoppled should be the tale to tell?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They tore them midst the irons, and slew them then and there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long we heard them snarling o'er that abundant cheer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night after night, O my sister, the story was the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still from the dark and the thicket the wild-wood were-wolves came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slew two men of the Volsungs whom the sword edge might not end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every day in the dawning did the King's own woodmen wend<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span><span class="i0">To behold those craftsmen's carving and rejoice King Siggeir's heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so was come last midnight, when I must play my part:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsooth when those first were murdered my heart was as blood and fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I deemed that my bonds must burst with my uttermost desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To free my naked hands, that the vengeance might be wrought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now was I wroth with the Gods, that had made the Volsungs for nought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I said: in the Day of their Doom a man's help shall they miss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will be as a wolf of the forest, if their kings must come to this;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or if Siggeir indeed be their king, and their envy has brought it about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dead in the dust lies Volsung, while the last of his seed dies out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therewith from out the thicket the grey wolves drew anigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the he-wolf fell on Sigi, but he gave forth never a cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I saw his lips that they smiled, and his steady eyes for a space;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therewith was the she-wolf's muzzle thrust into my very face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods helped not, but I helped; and I too grew wolfish then;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea I, who have borne the sword-hilt high mid the kings of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, lord of the golden harness, the flame of the Glittering Heath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must snarl to the she-wolf's snarling, and snap with greedy teeth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While my hands with the hand-bonds struggled; my teeth took hold the first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And amid her mighty writhing the bonds that bound me burst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As with Fenrir's Wolf it shall be: then the beast with the hopples I smote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When my left hand stiff with the bonds had got her by the throat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I turned when I had slain her, and there lay Sigi dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once more to the night of the forest the fretting wolf had fled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the thicket I hid till the dawning, and thence I saw the men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en Siggeir's heart-rejoicers, come back to the place again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gather the well-loved tidings: I looked and I knew for sooth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How hate had grown in my bosom and the death of my days of ruth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though unslain they departed from me, lest Siggeir come to doubt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hereafter, yea hereafter, they that turned the world about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raised Hell's abode o'er God-home, and mocked all men-folk's worth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall my hand turn back or falter, while these abide on earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because I once was a child, and sat on my father's knees;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span><span class="i0">But long methinks shall Siggeir bide merrily at ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the high-built house of the Goths, with his shielded earls around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His warders of day and of night-tide, and his world of peopled ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While his foe is a swordless outcast, a hunted beast of the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wolf of the holy places, where men-folk gather for good.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And didst thou think, my sister, when we sat in our summer bliss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the boughs of the Branstock, that the world was like to this?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As the moon and the twilight mingled, she stood with kindling eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And answered and said: "My brother, thou art strong, and thou shalt be wise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am nothing so wroth as thou art with the ways of death and hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thereof had I a deeming when all things were seeming well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sooth overlong it may linger; the children of murder shall thrive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While thy work is a weight for thine heart, and a toil for thy hand to drive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I wot that the King of the Goth-folk for his deeds shall surely pay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that I shall live to see it: but thy wrath shall pass away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long shalt thou live on the earth an exceeding glorious king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy words shall be told in the market, and all men of thy deeds shall sing:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh shall thy memory be, and thine eyes like mine shall gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the day unborn in the darkness, the last of all earthly days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last of the days of battle, when the host of the Gods is arrayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there is an end for ever of all who were once afraid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There as thou drawest thy sword, thou shalt think of the days that were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the foul shall still seem foul, and the fair shall still seem fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thy wit shall then be awakened, and thou shalt know indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why the brave man's spear is broken, and his war-shield fails at need;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why the loving is unbelov&egrave;d; why the just man falls from his state;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why the liar gains in a day what the soothfast strives for late.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, and thy deeds shalt thou know, and great shall thy gladness be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a picture all of gold thy life-days shalt thou see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And know that thou too wert a God to abide through the hurry and haste;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A God in the golden hall, a God on the rain-swept waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A God in the battle triumphant, a God on the heap of the slain:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span><span class="i0">And thine hope shall arise and blossom, and thy love shall be quickened again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then shalt thou see before thee the face of all earthly ill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt drink of the cup of awakening that thine hand hath holpen to fill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the side of the sons of Odin shalt thou fashion a tale to be told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the hall of the happy Baldur: nor there shall the tale grow old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the days before the changing, e'en those that over us pass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So harden thine heart, O brother, and set thy brow as the brass!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt do, and thy deeds shall be goodly, and the day's work shall be done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though nought but the wild deer see it. Nor yet shalt thou be alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever-more in thy waiting; for belike a fearful friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long days for thee may fashion, to help thee ere the end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now shalt thou bide in the wild-wood, and make thee a lair therein:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art here in the midst of thy foemen, and from them thou well mayst win<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatso thine heart desireth; yet be thou not too bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest the tale of the wood-abider too oft to the king be told.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere many days are departed again shall I see thy face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I may wot full surely of thine abiding-place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To send thee help and comfort; but when that hour is o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It were good, O last of the Volsungs, that I see thy face no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If so indeed it may be: but the Norns must fashion all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what the dawn hath fated on the hour of noon shall fall."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she kissed him and departed, for the day was nigh at hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by then she had left the woodways green lay the horse-fed land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the new-born daylight, and as she brushed the dew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the yellowing acres, all heaven o'erhead was blue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at last on that dwelling of Kings the golden sunlight lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the morn and the noon and the even built up another day.<br /></span>

<h4>Of the birth and fostering of Sinfiotli, Signy's Son.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So wrought is the will of King Siggeir, and he weareth Odin's sword<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span><span class="i0">And it lies on his knees in the council and hath no other lord:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he sendeth earls o'er the sea-flood to take King Volsung's land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those scattered and shepherdless sheep must come beneath his hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he holdeth the milk-white Signy as his handmaid and his wife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nought but his will she doeth, nor raiseth a word of strife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So his heart is praising his wisdom, and he deems him of most avail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the lords of the cunning that teacheth how to prevail.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now again in a half-month's wearing goes Signy into the wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And findeth her way by her wisdom to the dwelling of Volsung's child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was e'en as a house of the Dwarfs, a rock, and a stony cave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the heart of the midmost thicket by the hidden river's wave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There Signy found him watching how the white-head waters ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she said in her heart as she saw him that once more she had seen a man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His words were few and heavy, for seldom his sorrow slept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet ever his love went with them; and men say that Signy wept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she left that last of her kindred: yet wept she never more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the earls of Siggeir, and as lovely as before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was her face to all men's deeming: nor aught it changed for ruth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor for fear nor any longing; and no man said for sooth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she ever laughed thereafter till the day of her death was come.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So is Volsung's seed abiding in a rough and narrow home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wargear he gat him enough from the slaying of earls of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gold as much as he would; though indeed but now and again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fell on the men of the merchants, lest, wax he overbold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tale of the wood-abider too oft to the king should be told.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone in the woods he abided, and a master of masters was he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the craft of the smithying folk; and whiles would the hunter see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Belated amid the thicket, his forge's glimmering light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the boldest of all the fishers would hear his hammer benight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then dim waxed the tale of the Volsungs, and the word mid the wood-folk rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That a King of the Giants had wakened from amidst the stone-hedged close,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span><span class="i0">Where they slept in the heart of the mountains, and had come adown to dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the cave whence the Dwarfs were departed, and they said: It is aught but well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To come anigh to his house-door, or wander wide in his woods?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a tyrannous lord he is, and a lover of gold and of goods.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So win the long years over, and still sitteth Signy there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the King of the Goth-folk, and is waxen no less fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men and maids hath she gotten who are ready to work her will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the worship of her fairness, and remembrance of her ill.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So it fell on a morn of springtide, as Sigmund sat on the sward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By that ancient house of the Dwarf-kind and fashioned a golden sword?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the side of the hidden river he saw a damsel stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a manchild of ten summers was holding by her hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i6">"O Forest-dweller! harm not the child nor me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I bear a word of Signy's, and thus she saith to thee:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I send thee a man to foster; if his heart be good at need<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then may he help thy workday; but hearken my words and heed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou deem that his heart shall avail not, thy work is over-great<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou weary thy heart with such-like: let him wend the ways of his fate.'"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And no more word spake the maiden, but turned and gat her gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there by the side of the river the child abode alone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sigmund stood on his feet, and across the river he went.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he knew how the child was Siggeir's, and of Signy's fell intent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he took the lad on his shoulder, and bade him hold his sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waded back to his dwelling across the rushing ford:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the youngling fell a prattling, and asked of this and that,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As above the rattle of waters on Sigmund's shoulder he sat!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sigmund deemed in his heart that the boy would be bold enough.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he fostered him there in the woodland in life full hard and rough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the space of three months' wearing; and the lad was deft and strong,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span><span class="i0">Yet his sight was a grief to Sigmund because of his father's wrong.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On a morn to the son of King Siggeir Sigmund the Volsung said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I go to the hunting of deer, bide thou and bake our bread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against I bring the venison."<br /></span>
<span class="i10">So forth he fared on his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And came again with the quarry about the noon of day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quoth he: "Is the morn's work done?" But the boy said nought for a space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all white he was and quaking as he looked on Sigmund's face.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tell me, O Son of the Goth-king," quoth Sigmund, "how thou hast fared?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsooth, is the baking of bread so mighty a thing to be dared?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth the lad: "I went to the meal-sack, and therein was something quick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it moved, and I feared for the serpent, like a winter ashen stick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I saw on the stone last even: so I durst not deal with the thing."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Loud Sigmund laughed, and answered: "I have heard of that son of a king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who might not be scared from his bread for all the worms of the land."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therewith he went to the meal-sack and thrust therein his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drew forth an ash-grey adder, and a deadly worm it was:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he went to the door of the cave and set it down in the grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the King's son quaked and quivered: then he drew forth his sword from the sheath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"Now fearest thou this, that men call the serpent of death?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then said the son of King Siggeir: "I am young as yet for the war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet e'en such a blade shall I carry ere many a month be o'er."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then abroad went the King in the wind, and leaned on his naked sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood there many an hour, and mused on Signy's word.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at last when the moon was arisen, and the undark night begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sheathed the sword and cried: "Come forth, King Siggeir's son,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span><span class="i0">Thou shalt wend from out of the wild-wood and no more will I foster thee."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Forth came the son of Siggeir, and quaked his face to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thereof nought Sigmund noted, but bade him wend with him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they went through the summer night-tide by many a wood-way dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they came to a certain wood-lawn, and Sigmund lingered there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spake as his feet brushed o'er it: "The June flowers blossom fair."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they came to the skirts of the forest, and the meadows of the neat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the earliest wind of dawning blew over them soft and sweet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There stayed Sigmund the Volsung, and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i18">"King Siggeir's son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bide here till the birds are singing, and the day is well begun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then go to the house of the Goth-king, and find thou Signy the Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tell unto no man else the things thou hast heard and seen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to her shalt thou tell what thou wilt, and say this word withal:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mother, I come from the wild-wood, and he saith, whatever befal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone will I abide there, nor have such fosterlings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the sons of the Gods may help me, but never the sons of Kings.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go, then, with this word in thy mouth&mdash;or do thou after thy fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, if thou wilt, betray me!&mdash;and repent it early and late."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he turned his back on the acres, and away to the woodland strode;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the boy scarce bided the sunrise ere he went the homeward road;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he came to the house of the Goth-kings, and spake with Signy the Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor told he to any other the things he had heard and seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the heart of a king's son had he.<br /></span>
<span class="i14">But Signy hearkened his word;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long she pondered and said: "What is it my heart hath feared?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how shall it be with earth's people if the kin of the Volsungs die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And King Volsung unavenged in his mound by the sea-strand lie?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have given my best and bravest, as my heart's blood I would give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my heart and my fame and my body, that the name of Volsung might live.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo the first gift cast aback: and how shall it be with the last,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span><span class="i0">&mdash;If I find out the gift for the giving before the hour be passed?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Long while she mused and pondered while day was thrust on day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the king and the earls of the strangers seemed shades of the dreamtide grey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gone seemed all earth's people, save that woman mid the gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that man in the depths of the forest in the cave of the Dwarfs of old.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once in the dark she murmured: "Where then was the ancient song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the Gods were but twin-born once, and deemed it nothing wrong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mingle for the world's sake, whence had the &AElig;sir birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Vanir and the Dwarf-kind, and all the folk of earth?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now amidst those days that she pondered came a wife of the witch-folk there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman young and lovesome, and shaped exceeding fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she spake with Signy the Queen, and told her of deeds of her craft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how the might was with her her soul from her body to waft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to take the shape of another and give her fashion in turn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce then in the heart of Signy a sudden flame 'gan burn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the eyes of her soul saw all things, like the blind, whom the world's last fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath healed in one passing moment 'twixt his death and his desire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she thought: "Alone I will bear it; alone I will take the crime;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On me alone be the shaming, and the cry of the coming time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, and he for the life is fated and the help of many a folk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I for the death and the rest, and deliverance from the yoke."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then wan as the midnight moon she answered the woman and spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou art come to the Goth-queen's dwelling, wilt thou do so much for my sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for many a pound of silver and for rings of the ruddy gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to change thy body for mine ere the night is waxen old?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nought the witch-wife fair gainsaid it, and they went to the bower aloft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hand in hand and alone they sung the spell-song soft:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Signy looked on her guest, and lo, the face of a queen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the steadfast eyes of grey, that so many a grief had seen:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span><span class="i0">But the guest held forth a mirror, and Signy shrank aback<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the laughing lips and the eyes, and the hair of crispy black,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But though she shuddered and sickened, the false face changed no whit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ruddy and white it blossomed and the smiles played over it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hands were ready to cling, and beckoning lamps were the eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the light feet longed for the dance, and the lips for laughter and lies.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So that eve in the mid-hall's high-seat was the shape of Signy the Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While swiftly the feet of the witch-wife brushed over the moonlit green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the soul mid the gleam of the torches, her thought was of gain and of gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the soul of the wind-driven woman, swift-foot in the moonlight cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her thoughts were of men's lives' changing, and the uttermost ending of earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the day when death should be dead, and the new sun's nightless birth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Men say that about that midnight King Sigmund wakened and heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voice of a soft-speeched woman, shrill-sweet as a dawning bird;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he rose, and a woman indeed he saw by the door of the cave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her raiment wet to her midmost, as though with the river-wave:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he cried: "What wilt thou, what wilt thou? be thou womankind or fay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here is no good abiding, wend forth upon thy way!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She said: "I am nought but a woman, a maid of the earl-folk's kin:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I went by the skirts of the woodland to the house of my sister to win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have strayed from the way benighted: and I fear the wolves and the wild<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the glimmering of thy torchlight from afar was I beguiled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, slay me not on thy threshold, nor send me back again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the rattling waves of thy ford, that I crossed in terror and pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drive me not to the night and the darkness, for the wolves of the wood to devour.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am weak and thou art mighty: I will go at the dawning hour."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So Sigmund looked in her face and saw that she was fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he said: "Nay, nought will I harm thee, and thou mayst harbour here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God wot if thou fear'st not me, I have nought to fear thy face:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span><span class="i0">Though this house be the terror of men-folk, thou shalt find it as safe a place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though I were nought but thy brother; and then mayst thou tell, if thou wilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where dwelleth the dread of the woodland, the bearer of many a guilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though meseems for so goodly a woman it were all too ill a deed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In reward for the wood-wight's guesting to betray him in his need."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he took the hand of the woman and straightway led her in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where days agone the Dwarf-kind would their deeds of smithying win:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he kindled the half-slaked embers, and gave her of his cheer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the gold and the silver, and the fight-won raiment dear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soft was her voice, and she sung him sweet tales of yore agone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till all his heart was softened; and the man was all alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in many wise she wooed him; so they parted not that night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor slept till the morrow morning, when the woods were waxen bright:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And high above the tree-boughs shone the sister of the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hushed were the water-ouzels with the coming of the noon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she stepped from the bed of Sigmund, and left the Dwarf's abode;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turned to the dwellings of men, and the ways where the earl-folk rode.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But next morn from the house of the Goth-king the witch-wife went her ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gold and goods and silver, such store as a queen might praise.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But no long while with Sigmund dwelt remembrance of that night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid his kingly longings and his many deeds of might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It fled like the dove in the forest or the down upon the blast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet heavy and sad were the years, that even in suchwise passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As here it is written aforetime.<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Thence were ten years worn by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When unto that hidden river a man-child drew anigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he looked and beheld how Sigmund wrought on a helm of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the crag and the stony dwelling where the Dwarf-kin wrought of old.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the boy cried: "Thou art the wood-wight of whom my mother spake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now will I come to thy dwelling."<br /></span>
<span class="i14">So the rough stream did he take,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span><span class="i0">And the welter of the waters rose up to his chin and more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But so stark and strong he waded that he won the further shore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he came and gazed on Sigmund: but the Volsung laughed, and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"As fast thou runnest toward me as others in their dread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Run over the land and the water: what wilt thou, son of a king?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the lad still gazed on Sigmund, and he said: "A wondrous thing!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here is the cave and the river, and all tokens of the place:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my mother Signy told me none might behold that face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And keep his flesh from quaking: but at thee I quake not aught:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure I must journey further, lest her errand come to nought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I would that my foster-father should be such a man as thou."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Sigmund answered and said: "Thou shalt bide in my dwelling now;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou mayst wot full surely that thy mother's will is done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By this token and no other, that thou lookedst on Volsung's son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smiledst fair in his face: but tell me thy name and thy years:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what are the words of Signy that the son of the Goth-king bears?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sinfiotli they call me," he said, "and ten summers have I seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this is the only word that I bear from Signy the Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That once more a man she sendeth the work of thine hands to speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he be of the Kings or the Gods thyself shalt know in thy need."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So Sigmund looked on the youngling and his heart unto him yearned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he thought: "Shall I pay the hire ere the worth of the work be earned?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what hath my heart to do to cherish Siggeir's son;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A brand belike for the burning when the last of its work is done?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But there in the wild and the thicket those twain awhile abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the lad laid Sigmund full many a weary load,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrust him mid all dangers, and he bore all passing well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where hardihood might help him; but his heart was fierce and fell;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span><span class="i0">And ever said Sigmund the Volsung: The lad hath plenteous part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the guile and malice of Siggeir, and in Signy's hardy heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But why should I cherish and love him, since the end must come at last?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now a summer and winter and spring o'er those men of the wilds had pass'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And summer was there again, when the Volsung spake on a day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I will wend to the wood-deer's hunting, but thou at home shalt stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deal with the baking of bread against the even come."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he went and came on the hunting and brought the venison home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the child, as ever his wont was, was glad of his coming back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said: "Thou hast gotten us venison, and the bread shall nowise lack."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yea," quoth Sigmund the Volsung, "hast thou kneaded the meal that was yonder?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Yea, and what other?" he said; "though therein forsooth was a wonder:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when I would handle the meal-sack therein was something quick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the life of an eel-grig were set in an ashen stick:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the meal must into the oven, since we were lacking bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all that is kneaded together, and the wonder is baked and dead."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigmund laughed and answered: "Thou hast kneaded up therein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deadliest of all adders that is of the creeping kin:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So tonight from the bread refrain thee, lest thy bane should come of it."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For here, the tale of the elders doth men a marvel to wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That such was the shaping of Sigmund among all earthly kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That unhurt he handled adders and other deadly things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And might drink unscathed of venom: but Sinfiotli so was wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That no sting of creeping creatures would harm his body aught.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But now full glad was Sigmund, and he let his love arise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the huge-limbed son of Signy with the fierce and eager eyes;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span><span class="i0">And all deeds of the sword he learned him, and showed him feats of war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where sea and forest mingle, and up from the ocean's shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The highway leads to the market, and men go up and down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the spear-hedged wains of the merchants fare oft to the Goth-folk's town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet then Sinfiotli deemed it to look on the bale-fires' light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bickering blood-reeds' tangle, and the fallow blades of fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in three years' space were his war-deeds far more than the deeds of a man:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But dread was his face to behold ere the battle-play began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grey and dreadful his face when the last of the battle sank.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so the years won over, and the joy of the woods they drank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they gathered gold and silver, and plenteous outland goods.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But they came to a house on a day in the uttermost part of the woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smote on the door and entered, when a long while no man bade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo, a gold-hung hall, and two men on the benches laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In slumber as deep as the death; and gold rings great and fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those sleepers bore on their bodies, and broidered southland gear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over the head of each there hung a wolf-skin grey.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the drift of a cloudy dream wrapt Sigmund's soul away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his eyes were set on the wolf-skin, and long he gazed thereat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And remembered the words he uttered when erst on the beam he sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the Gods should miss a man in the utmost Day of Doom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And win a wolf in his stead; and unto his heart came home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thought, as he gazed on the wolf-skin and the other days waxed dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he gathered the thing in his hand, and did it over him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in likewise did Sinfiotli as he saw his fosterer do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then lo, a fearful wonder, for as very wolves they grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In outward shape and semblance, and they howled out wolfish things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the grey dogs of the forest; though somewhat the hearts of kings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abode in their bodies of beasts. Now sooth is the tale to tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the men in the fair-wrought raiment were kings' sons bound by a spell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wend as wolves of the wild-wood, for each nine days of the ten,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span><span class="i0">And to lie all spent for a season when they gat their shapes of men.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So Sigmund and his fellow rush forth from the golden place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though their kings' hearts bade them the backward way to trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto their Dwarf-wrought dwelling, and there abide the change,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet their wolfish habit drave them wide through the wood to range,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And draw nigh to the dwellings of men and fly upon the prey.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And lo now, a band of hunters on the uttermost woodland way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they spy those dogs of the forest, and fall on with the spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor deemed that any other but woodland beasts they were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that easy would be the battle: short is the tale to tell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For every man of the hunters amid the thicket fell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then onwards fare those were-wolves, and unto the sea they turn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their ravening hearts are heavy, and sore for the prey they yearn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo, in the last of the thicket a score of the chaffering men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sinfiotli was wild for the onset, but Sigmund was wearying then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the glimmering gold of his Dwarf-house, and he bade refrain from the folk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wrath burned in the eyes of Sinfiotli, and forth from the thicket he broke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then rose the axes aloft, and the swords flashed bright in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And but little more it needed that the race of the Volsungs was done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the folk of the Gods' begetting: but at last they quelled the war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no man again of the sea-folk should ever sit by the oar.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Sinfiotli fay weary and faint, but Sigmund howled over the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wrath in his heart there gathered, and a dim thought wearied his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his tangled wolfish wit, that might never understand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though some God in his dreaming had wasted the work of his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forgotten his craft of creation; then his wrath swelled up amain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he turned and fell on Sinfiotli, who had wrought the wrack and the bane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And across the throat he tore him as his very mortal foe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till a cold dead corpse by the sea-strand his fosterling lay alow:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span><span class="i0">Then wearier yet grew Sigmund, and the dim wit seemed to pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his heart grown cold and feeble; when lo, amid the grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came two weazles bickering, and one bit his mate by the head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till she lay there dead before him: then he sorrowed over her dead:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no long while he abode there, but into the thicket he went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wolfish heart of Sigmund knew somewhat his intent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he came again with a herb-leaf and laid it on his mate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she rose up whole and living and no worser of estate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than ever she was aforetime, and the twain went merry away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then swiftly rose up Sigmund from where his fosterling lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a long while searched the thicket, till that three-leaved herb he found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he laid it on Sinfiotli, who rose up hale and sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ever he was in his life-days. But now in hate they had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hapless work of the witch-folk, and the skins that their bodies clad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they turn their faces homeward and a weary way they go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they come to the hidden river, and the glimmering house they know.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There now they abide in peace, and wend abroad no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the last of the nine days perished, and the spell for a space was o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they might cast their wolf-shapes: so they stood on their feet upright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great men again as aforetime, and they came forth into the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looked in each other's faces, and belike a change was there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since they did on the bodies of wolves, and lay in the wood-wolves' lair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they looked, and sore they wondered, and they both for speech did yearn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">First then spake out Sinfiotli: "Sure I had a craft to learn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou hadst a lesson to teach, that I left the dwelling of kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And came to the wood-wolves' dwelling; thou hast taught me many things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the Gods have taught me more, and at last have abased us both,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That of nought that lieth before us our hearts and our hands may be loth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come then, how long shall I tarry till I fashion something great?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, Master, and make me a master that I do the deeds of fate."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Heavy was Sigmund's visage but fierce did his eyen glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This is the deed of thy mastery;&mdash;we twain shall slay my foe&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how if the foe were thy father?"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Then he telleth him Siggeir's tale:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saith: "Now think upon it; how shall thine heart avail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bear the curse that cometh if thy life endureth long&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man that slew his father and amended wrong with wrong?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet if the Gods have made thee a man unlike all men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For thou startest not, nor palest), can I forbear it then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To use the thing they have fashioned lest the Volsung seed should die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unavenged King Volsung in his mound by the sea-strand lie?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then loud laughed out Sinfiotli, and he said: "I wot indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Signy is my mother, and her will I help at need:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the fox of the King-folk my father, that adder of the brake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who gave me never a blessing, and many a cursing spake?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, have I in sooth a father, save him that cherished my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lord of the Helm of Terror, the King of the Flame of Strife?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo now my hand is ready to strike what stroke thou wilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I am the sword of the Gods: and thine hand shall hold the hilt."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fierce glowed the eyes of King Sigmund, for he knew the time was come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the curse King Siggeir fashioned at last shall seek him home:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of what shall follow after, be it evil days, or bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or praise, or the cursing of all men,&mdash;the Gods shall see to this.<br /></span>

<h4>Of the slaying of Siggeir the Goth-king.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So there are those kings abiding, and they think of nought but the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the time at last shall serve them, to wend on the perilous way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so in the first of winter, when nights grow long and mirk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fare unto Siggeir's dwelling and seek wherein to lurk.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span><span class="i0">And by hap 'twas the tide of twilight, ere the watch of the night was set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the watch of the day was departed, as Sinfiotli minded yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So now by a passage he wotted they gat them into the bower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where lay the biggest wine-tuns, and there they abode the hour:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anigh to the hall it was, but no man came thereto,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now and again the cup-lord when King Siggeir's wine he drew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea and so nigh to the feast-hall, that they saw the torches shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the cup-lord was departed with King Siggeir's dear-bought wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they heard the glee of the people, and the horns and the beakers' din,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the feast was dight in the hall and the earls were merry therein.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calm was the face of Sigmund, and clear were his eyes and bright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sinfiotli gnawed on his shield-rim, and his face was haggard and white:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he deemed the time full long, ere the fallow blades should leap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the hush of the midnight feast-hall o'er King Siggeir's golden sleep.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now it fell that two little children, Queen Signy's youngest-born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were about the hall that even, and amid the glee of the horn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They played with a golden toy, and trundled it here and there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus to that lurking-bower they drew exceeding near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When there fell a ring from their toy, and swiftly rolled away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And into the place of the wine-tuns, and by Sigmund's feet made stay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the little ones followed after, and came to the lurking-place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where lay those night-abiders, and met them face to face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fled, ere they might hold them, aback to the thronging hall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then leapt those twain to their feet lest the sword and the murder fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On their hearts in their narrow lair and they die without a stroke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But e'en as they met the torch-light and the din and tumult of folk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo there on the very threshold did Signy the Volsung stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one of her last-born children she had on either hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the children had cried: "We have seen them&mdash;those two among the wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their hats are wide and white, and their garments tinkle and shine."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So while men ran to their weapons, those children Signy took,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span><span class="i0">And went to meet her kinsmen: then once more did Sigmund look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the face of his father's daughter, and kind of heart he grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the clash of the coming battle anigh the doomed men drew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wan and fell was Signy; and she cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i18">"The end is near!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;And thou with the smile on thy face and the joyful eyes and clear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with these thy two betrayers first stain the edge of fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For why should the fruit of my body outlive my soul tonight?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But he cried in the front of the spear-hedge; "Nay this shall be far from me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To slay thy children sackless, though my death belike they be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now men will be dealing, sister, and old the night is grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair in the house of my fathers the benches are bestrown."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So she stood aside and gazed: but Sinfiotli taketh them up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breaketh each tender body as a drunkard breaketh a cup;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a dreadful voice he crieth, and casteth them down the hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Goth-folk sunder before them, and at Siggeir's feet they fall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the fallow blades leapt naked, and on the battle came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the tide of the winter ocean sweeps up to the beaconing flame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But firm in the midst of onset Sigmund the Volsung stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stirred no more for the sword-strokes than the oldest oak of the wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall shake to the herd-boys' whittles: white danced his war-flame's gleam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft to men's beholding his eyes of God would beam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear from the sword-blades' tangle, and often for a space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amazed the garth of murder stared deedless on his face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor back nor forward moved he: but fierce Sinfiotli went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the spears were set the thickest, and sword with sword was blent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And great was the death before him, till he slipped in the blood and fell:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the shield-garth compassed Sigmund, and short is the tale to tell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they bore him down unwounded, and bonds about him cast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor sore hurt is Sinfiotli, but is hoppled strait and fast.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the Goth-folk went to slumber when the hall was washed from blood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a long while wakened Siggeir, for fell and fierce was his mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the days of his kingship seemed nothing worth as then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While fared the son of Volsung as well as the worst of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While yet that son of Signy lay untormented there:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea the past days of his kingship seemed blossomless and bare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since all their might had failed him to quench the Volsung kin.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So when the first grey dawning a new day did begin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Siggeir bade his bondsmen to dight an earthen mound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anigh to the house of the Goth-kings amid the fruit-grown ground:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that house of death was twofold, for 'twas sundered by a stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into two woeful chambers: alone and not alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those vanquished thralls of battle therein should bide their hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That each might hear the tidings of the other's baleful bower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet have no might to help him. So now the twain they brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weary-dull was Sinfiotli, with eyes that looked at nought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sigmund fresh and clear-eyed went to the deadly hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the song arose within him as he sat within its wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor aught durst Siggeir mock him, as he had good will to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But went his ways when the bondmen brought the roofing turfs thereto.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And that was at eve of the day; and lo now, Signy the white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wan-faced and eager-eyed stole through the beginning of night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the place where the builders built, and the thralls with lingering hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had roofed in the grave of Sigmund and hidden the glory of lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But over the head of Sinfiotli for a space were the rafters bare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold then to the thralls she gave, and promised them days full fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If they held their peace for ever of the deed that then she did:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nothing they gainsayed it; so she drew forth something hid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wrappings of wheat-straw winded, and into Sinfiotli's place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She cast it all down swiftly; then she covereth up her face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beneath the winter starlight she wended swift away.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span><span class="i0">But her gift do the thralls deem victual, and the thatch on the hall they lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And depart, they too, to their slumber, now dight was the dwelling of death.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigmund hears Sinfiotli, how he cries through the stone and saith:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Best unto babe is mother, well sayeth the elder's saw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here hath Signy sent me swine's-flesh in windings of wheaten straw."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And again he held him silent of bitter words or of sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quoth Sigmund, "What hath betided? is an adder in the meat?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then loud his fosterling laughed: "Yea, a worm of bitter tooth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The serpent of the Branstock, the sword of thy days of youth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have felt the hilts aforetime; I have felt how the letters run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On each side of the trench of blood and the point of that glorious one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O mother, O mother of kings! we shall live and our days shall be sweet!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have loved thee well aforetime, I shall love thee more when we meet."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigmund heard the sword-point smite on the stone wall's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slowly mid the darkness therethrough he heard it gride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As against it bore Sinfiotli: but he cried out at the last:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"It biteth, O my fosterer! It cleaves the earth-bone fast!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now learn we the craft of the masons that another day may come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we build a house for King Siggeir, a strait unlovely home."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then in the grave-mound's darkness did Sigmund the king upstand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unto that saw of battle he set his naked hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hard the gift of Odin home to their breasts they drew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sawed Sigmund, sawed Sinfiotli, till the stone was cleft atwo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they met and kissed together: then they hewed and heaved full hard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till lo, through the bursten rafters the winter heavens bestarred!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they leap out merry-hearted; nor is there need to say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A many words between them of whither was the way.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For they took the night-watch sleeping, and slew them one and all<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span><span class="i0">And then on the winter fagots they made them haste to fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They pile the oak-trees cloven, and when the oak-beams fail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They bear the ash and the rowan, and build a mighty bale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the dwelling of Siggeir, and lay the torch therein.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they drew their swords and watched it till the flames began to win<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard on to the mid-hall's rafters, and those feasters of the folk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the fire-flakes fell among them, to their last of days awoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the gable-door stood Sigmund, and fierce Sinfiotli stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red-lit by the door of the women in the lane of blazing wood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To death each doorway opened, and death was in the hall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then amid the gathered Goth-folk 'gan Siggeir the king to call:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Who lit the fire I burn in, and what shall buy me peace?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will ye take my heaped-up treasure, or ten years of my fields' increase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or half of my father's kingdom? O toilers at the oar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O wasters of the sea-plain, now labour ye no more!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But take the gifts I bid you, and lie upon the gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clothe your limbs in purple and the silken women hold!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But a great voice cried o'er the fire: "Nay, no such men are we,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No tuggers at the hawser, no wasters of the sea:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We will have the gold and the purple when we list such things to win<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now we think on our fathers, and avenging of our kin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not all King Siggeir's kingdom, and not all the world's increase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever and for ever, shall buy thee life and peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now is the tree-bough blossomed that sprang from murder's seed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the death-doomed and the buried are they that do the deed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now when the dead shall ask thee by whom thy days were done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt say by Sigmund the Volsung, and Sinfiotli, Signy's son."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then stark fear fell on the earl-folk, and silent they abide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the flaming penfold; and again the great voice cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the Goth-king's golden pillars grew red amidst the blaze:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span><span class="i0">"Ye women of the Goth-folk, come forth upon your ways;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou, Signy, O my sister, come forth from death and hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That beneath the boughs of the Branstock once more we twain may dwell."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Forth came the white-faced women and passed Sinfiotli's sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free by the glaive of Odin the trembling pale ones poured,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But amid their hurrying terror came never Signy's feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pearls of the throne of Siggeir shrunk in the fervent heat.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the men of war surged outward to the twofold doors of bane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there played the sword of Sigmund amidst the fiery lane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the gable door-way, and by the woman's door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sinfiotli sang to the sword-edge amid the bale-fire's roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And back again to the burning the earls of the Goth-folk shrank:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the light low licked the tables, and the wine of Siggeir drank.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lo now to the woman's doorway, the steel-watched bower of flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clad in her queenly raiment King Volsung's daughter came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before Sinfiotli's sword-point; and she said: "O mightiest son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Best now is our departing in the day my grief hath won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the many days of toiling, and the travail of my womb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hate, and the fire of longing: thou, son, and this day of the doom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have long been as one to my heart; and now shall I leave you both,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well ye may wot of the slumber my heart is nothing loth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the more, as, meseemeth, thy day shall not be long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To weary thee with labour and mingle wrong with wrong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, and I wot that the daylight thine eyes had never seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save for a great king's murder and the shame of a mighty queen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But let thy soul, I charge thee, o'er all these things prevail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make thy short day glorious and leave a goodly tale."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She kissed him and departed, and unto Sigmund went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As now against the dawning grey grew the winter bent:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span><span class="i0">As the night and the morning mingled he saw her face once more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he deemed it fair and ruddy as in the days of yore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet fast the tears fell from her, and the sobs upheaved her breast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she said: "My youth was happy; but this hour belike is best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the days of my life-tide, that soon shall have an end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have come to greet thee, Sigmund, then back again must I wend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his bed the Goth-king dighteth: I have lain therein, time was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loathed the sleep I won there: but lo, how all things pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hearts are changed and softened, for lovely now it seems.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet fear not my forgetting: I shall see thee in my dreams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mighty king of the world 'neath the boughs of the Branstock green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thine earls and thy lords about thee as the Volsung fashion hath been.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there shall all ye remember how I loved the Volsung name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor spared to spend for its blooming my joy, and my life, and my fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For hear thou: that Sinfiotli, who hath wrought out our desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hath compassed about King Siggeir with this sea of a deadly fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who brake thy grave asunder&mdash;my child and thine he is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begot in that house of the Dwarf-kind for no other end than this;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The son of Volsung's daughter, the son of Volsung's son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look, look! might another helper this deed with thee have done?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And indeed as the word she uttereth, high up the red flames flare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the nether floor of the heavens: and yet men see them there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The golden roofs of Siggeir, the hall of the silver door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the Goths and the Gods had builded to last for evermore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She said: "Farewell, my brother, for the earls my candles light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I must wend me bedward lest I lose the flower of night."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And soft and sweet she kissed him, ere she turned about again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a little while was Signy beheld of the eyes of men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as she crossed the threshold day brightened at her back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor once did she turn her earthward from the reek and the whirling wrack,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span><span class="i0">But fair in the fashion of Queens passed on to the heart of the hall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And then King Siggeir's roof-tree upheaved for its utmost fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its huge walls clashed together, and its mean and lowly things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fire of death confounded with the tokens of the kings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sign for many people on the land of the Goths it lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lamp of the earth none needed, for the bright sun brought the day.<br /></span>

<h4>How Sigmund cometh to the Land of the Volsungs again, and of the
death of Sinfiotli his Son.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Sigmund the king bestirs him, and Sinfiotli, Sigmund's son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they gather a host together, and many a mighty one;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they set the ships in the sea-flood and sail from the stranger's shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the beaks of the golden dragons see the Volsungs' land once more:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men's hearts are fulfilled of joyance; and they cry, The sun shines now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With never a curse to hide it, and they shall reap that sow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then for many a day sits Sigmund 'neath the boughs of the Branstock green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his earls and lords about him as the Volsung wont hath been.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft he thinketh on Signy and oft he nameth her name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tells how she spent her joyance and her lifedays and her fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the Volsung kin might blossom and bear the fruit of worth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the hope of unborn people and the harvest of the earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And again he thinks of the word that he spake that other day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How he should abide there lonely when his kin was passed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their glory and sole avenger, their after-summer seed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now for their fame's advancement, and the latter days to speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He weddeth a wife of the King-folk; Borghild she had to name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the woman was fair and lovely and bore him sons of fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men call them Hamond and Helgi, and when Helgi first saw light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came the Norns to his cradle and gave him life full bright,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span><span class="i0">And called him Sunlit Hill, Sharp Sword, and Land of Rings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade him be lovely and great, and a joy in the tale of kings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he waxed up fair and mighty, and no worser than their word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet are the tales of his life-days, and the wonders of his sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Maid of the Shield that he wedded, and how he changed his life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of marvels wrought in the gravemound where he rested from the strife.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the tale of Sinfiotli telleth, that wide in the world he went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a wall of ravens the edge of his warflame rent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft he drave the war-prey and wasted many a land:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst King Hunding's battle he strengthened Helgi's hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he went before the banners amidst the steel-grown wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the sons of Hunding gathered and Helgi's hope withstood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor less he mowed the war-swathe in Helgi's glorious day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the kings of the hosts at the Wolf-crag set the battle in array.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then at home by his father's high-seat he wore the winter through;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the marvel of all men he was for the deeds whereof they knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the deeds whereof none wotted, and the deeds to follow after.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And yet but a little while he loved the song and the laughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wine that was drunk in peace, and the swordless lying down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the deedless day's uprising and the ungirt golden gown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he thought of the word of his mother, that his day should not be long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To weary his soul with labour or mingle wrong with wrong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his heart was exceeding hungry o'er all men to prevail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make his short day glorious and leave a goodly tale.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So when green leaves were lengthening and the spring was come again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He set his ships in the sea-flood and sailed across the main;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the brother of Queen Borghild was his fellow in the war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A king of hosts hight Gudrod; and each to each they swore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plighted troth for the helping, and the parting of the prey.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now a long way over the sea-flood they went ashore on a day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fought with a mighty folk-king, and overcame at last:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then wide about his kingdom the net of steel they cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the prey was great and goodly that they drave unto the strand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a greedy heart is Gudrod, and a king of griping hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though nought he blench from the battle; so he speaks on a morning fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saith:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"Upon the foreshore the booty will we share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou wilt help me, fellow, before we sail our ways."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sinfiotli laughed, and answered: "O'ershort methinks the days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That two kings of war should chaffer like merchants of the men:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will come again in the even and look on thy dealings then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take the share thou givest."<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Then he went his ways withal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drank day-long in his warship as in his father's hall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And came again in the even: now hath Gudrod shared the spoil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And throughout that day of summer not light had been his toil:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsooth his heap was the lesser; but Sinfiotli looked thereon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw that a goodly getting had Borghild's brother won.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clean-limbed and stark were the horses, and the neat were fat and sleek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the men-thralls young and stalwart, and the women young and meek;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair-gilt was the harness of battle, and the raiment fresh and bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the household stuff new-fashioned for lords' and earls' delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his own then looked Sinfiotli, and great it was forsooth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But half-foundered were the horses, and a sight for all men's ruth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were the thin-ribbed hungry cow-kind; and the thralls both carle and quean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were the wilful, the weak, and the witless, and the old and the ill-beseen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoilt was the harness and house-gear, and the raiment rags of cloth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Sinfiotli's men beheld it and grew exceeding wroth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sinfiotli laughed and answered: "The day's work hath been meet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast done well, war-brother, to sift the chaff from the wheat<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span><span class="i0">Nought have kings' sons to meddle with the refuse of the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shall warriors burden their long-ships with things of nothing worth."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he cried across the sea-strand in a voice exceeding great:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Depart, ye thralls of the battle; ye have nought to do to wait!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old, young, and good, and evil, depart and share the spoil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That burden of the battle, that spring and seed of toil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;But thou king of the greedy heart, thou king of the thievish grip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What now wilt thou bear to the sea-strand and set within my ship<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To buy thy life from the slaying? Unmeet for kings to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a king the breaker of troth, of a king the stealer of gear."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then mad-wroth waxed King Gudrod, and he cried: "Stand up, my men!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slay this wood-abider lest he slay his brothers again!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But no sword leapt from its sheath, and his men shrank back in dread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Sinfiotli's brow grew smoother, and at last he spake and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Indeed thou art very brother of my father Sigmund's wife:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou do so much for thine honour, wilt thou do so much for thy life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to bide my sword on the island in the pale of the hazel wands?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I know thee no battle-blencher, but a valiant man of thine hands."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now nought King Gudrod gainsayeth, and men dight the hazelled field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there on the morrow morning they clash the sword and shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fallow blades are leaping: short is the tale to tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For with the third stroke stricken to field King Gudrod fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So there in the holm they lay him; and plenteous store of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sinfiotli lays beside him amid that hall of mould;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For he gripped," saith the son of Sigmund, "and gathered for such a day."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sinfiotli and his fellows o'er the sea-flood sail away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And come to the land of the Volsungs: but Borghild heareth the tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And into the hall she cometh with eager face and pale<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span><span class="i0">As the kings were feasting together, and glad was Sigmund grown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the words of Sinfiotli's battle, and the tale of his great renown:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there sat the sons of Borghild, and they hearkened and were glad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of their brother born in the wild-wood, and the crown of fame he had.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So she stood before King Sigmund, and spread her hands abroad:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I charge thee now, King Sigmund, as thou art the Volsungs' lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell me of my brother, why cometh he not from the sea?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth Sinfiotli: "Well thou wottest and the tale hath come to thee:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The white swords met in the island; bright there did the war-shields shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there thy brother abideth, for his hand was worser than mine."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But she heeded him never a whit, but cried on Sigmund and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I charge thee now, King Sigmund, as thou art the lord of my bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drive this wolf of the King-folk from out thy guarded land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest all we of thine house and kindred should fall beneath his hand."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then spake King Sigmund the Volsung: "When thou hast heard the tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt know that somewhat thy brother of his oath to my son did fail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor fell the man all sackless: nor yet need Sigmund's son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For any slain in sword-field to any soul atone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet for the love I bear thee, and because thy love I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And because the man was mighty, and far afield would go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will lay down a mighty weregild, a heap of the ruddy gold."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But no word answered Borghild, for her heart was grim and cold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she went from the hall of the feasting, and lay in her bower a while;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor speech she took, nor gave it, but brooded deadly guile.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now again on the morrow to Sigmund the king she went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she saith that her wrath hath failed her, and that well is she content<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take the king's atonement; and she kissed him soft and sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she kissed Sinfiotli his son, and sat down in the golden seat<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span><span class="i0">All merry and glad by seeming, and blithe to most and least.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And again she biddeth King Sigmund that he hold a funeral feast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For her brother slain on the island; and nought he gainsayeth her will.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so on an eve of the autumn do men the beakers fill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the earls are gathered together 'neath the boughs of the Branstock green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There gold-clad mid the feasting went Borghild, Sigmund's Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she poured the wine for Sinfiotli, and smiled in his face and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Drink now of this cup from mine hand, and bury we hate that is dead."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he took the cup from her fingers, nor drank but pondered long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the gathering days of his labour, and the intermingled wrong.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now he sat by the side of his father; and Sigmund spake a word:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O son, why sittest thou silent mid the glee of earl and lord?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I look in the cup," quoth Sinfiotli, "and hate therein I see."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Well looked it is," said Sigmund; "give thou the cup to me,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he drained it dry to the bottom; for ye mind how it was writ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That this king might drink of venom, and have no hurt of it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the song sprang up in the hall, and merry was Sigmund's heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he drank of the wine of King-folk and thrust all care apart.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the second time came Borghild and stood before the twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she said: "O valiant step-son, how oft shall I say it in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That my hate for thee hath perished, and the love hath sprouted green?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou thrust my gift away, and shame the hand of a queen?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he took the cup from her fingers, and pondered over it long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought on the labour that should be, and the wrong that amendeth wrong.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then spake Sigmund the King: "O son, what aileth thine heart,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span><span class="i0">When the earls of men are merry, and thrust all care apart?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But he said: "I have looked in the cup, and I see the deadly snare."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Well seen it is," quoth Sigmund, "but thy burden I may bear."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he took the beaker and drained it, and the song rose up in the hall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair bethought King Sigmund his latter days befall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But again came Borghild the Queen and stood with the cup in her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said: "They are idle liars, those singers of every land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sing how thou fearest nothing; for thou losest valour and might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And art fain to live for ever."<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Then she stretched forth her fingers white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he took the cup from her hand, nor drank, but pondered long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the toil that begetteth toil, and the wrong that beareth wrong.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Sigmund turned him about, and he said: "What aileth thee, son?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall our life-days never be merry, and our labour never be done?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Sinfiotli said: "I have looked, and lo there is death in the cup."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the song, and the tinkling of harp-strings to the roof-tree winded up:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sigmund was dreamy with wine and the wearing of many a year;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the noise and the glee of the people as the sound of the wild woods were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the blossoming boughs of the Branstock were the wild trees waving about;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he said: "Well seen, my fosterling; let the lip then strain it out."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Sinfiotli laughed and answered: "I drink unto Odin then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Dwellers up in God-home, the lords of the lives of men."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He drank as he spake the word, and forthwith the venom ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a chill flood over his heart, and down fell the mighty man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With never an uttered death-word and never a death-changed look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the floor of the hall of the Volsungs beneath his falling shook.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then up rose the elder of days with a great and bitter cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lifted the head of the fallen, and none durst come anigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hearken the words of his sorrow, if any words he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But such as the Father of all men might speak over Baldur dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And again, as before the death-stroke, waxed the hall of the Volsungs dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once more he seemed in the forest, where he spake with nought but him.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he lifted him up from the hall-floor and bore him on his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men who saw Sinfiotli deemed his heart had gotten rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his eyes were no more dreadful. Forth fared the Volsung child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Signy's son through the doorway; and the wind was great and wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the moon rode high in the heavens, and whiles it shone out bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whiles the clouds drew over. So went he through the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the dwellings of man-folk were a long while left behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came he unto the thicket and the houses of the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the feet of the hoary mountains, and the dwellings of the deer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the heaths without a shepherd, and the houseless dales and drear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then lo, a mighty water, a rushing flood and wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no ferry for the shipless; so he went along its side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a man that seeketh somewhat: but it widened toward the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the moon sank down in the west, and he went o'er a desert lea.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But lo, in that dusk ere the dawning a glimmering over the flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sound of the cleaving of waters, and Sigmund the Volsung stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the edge of the swirling eddy, and a white-sailed boat he saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its keel ran light on the strand with the last of the dying flaw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But therein was a man most mighty, grey-clad like the mountain-cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One-eyed and seeming ancient, and he spake and hailed him aloud:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now whither away, King Sigmund, for thou farest far to-night?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Spake the King: "I would cross this water, for my life hath lost its light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mayhap there be deeds for a king to be found on the further shore."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My senders," quoth the shipman, "bade me waft a great king o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So set thy burden a shipboard, for the night's face looks toward day."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So betwixt the earth and the water his son did Sigmund lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lo, when he fain would follow, there was neither ship nor man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor aught but his empty bosom beside that water wan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That whitened by little and little as the night's face looked to the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he stood a long while gazing and then turned and gat him away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ere the sun of the noon-tide across the meadows shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sigmund the King of the Volsungs was set in his father's throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he hearkened and doomed and portioned, and did all the deeds of a king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the autumn waned and perished, and the winter brought the spring.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>Of the last battle of King Sigmund, and the death of him.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now is Queen Borghild driven from the Volsung's bed and board,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unwedded sitteth Sigmund an exceeding mighty lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fareth oft to the war-field, and addeth fame to fame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where'er are the great ones told of his sons shall the people name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But short was their day of harvest and their reaping of renown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while men stood by to marvel they gained their latest crown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Sigmund alone abideth of all the Volsung seed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the folk that the Gods had fashioned lest the earth should lack a deed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he said: "The tree was stalwart, but its boughs are old and worn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where now are the children departed, that amidst my life were born?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not the men about me, and they know not of my ways:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am nought but a picture of battle, and a song for the people to praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I must strive with the deeds of my kingship, and yet when mine hour is come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It shall meet me as glad as the goodman when he bringeth the last load home."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now there was a king of the Islands, whom the tale doth Eylimi call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saith he was wise and valiant, though his kingdom were but small:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span><span class="i0">He had one only daughter that Hiordis had to name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman wise and shapely beyond the praise of fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now saith the son of King Volsung that his time is short enow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To labour the Volsung garden, and the hand must be set to the plough:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he sendeth an earl of the people to King Eylimi's high-built hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing the gifts and the tokens, and this word in his mouth withal:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"King Sigmund the son of Volsung hath sent me here with a word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That plenteous good of thy daughter among all folk he hath heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he wooeth that wisest of women that she may sit on his throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lie in the bed of the Volsungs, and be his wife alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he saith that he thinketh surely she shall bear the kings of the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And maybe the best and the greatest of all who are deemed of worth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now hereof would he have an answer within a half-month's space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these gifts meanwhile he giveth for the increase of thy grace."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So King Eylimi hearkened the message, and hath no word to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For an earl of King Lyngi the mighty is come that very day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He too for the wooing of Hiordis: and Lyngi's realm is at hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But afar King Sigmund abideth o'er many a sea and land:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the man is young and eager, and grim and guileful of mood.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last he sayeth: "Abide here such space as thou deemest good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But tomorn shalt thou have thine answer that thine heart may the lighter be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the hearkening of harp and songcraft, and the dealing with game and glee."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he went to Queen Hiordis bower, where she worked in the silk and the gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deeds of the world that should be, and the deeds that were of old.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he stood before her and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i14">"I have spoken a word, time was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thy will should rule thy wedding; and now hath it come to pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That again two kings of the people will woo thy body to bed."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span><span class="i0">So she rose to her feet and hearkened: "And which be they?" she said.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He spake: "The first is Lyngi, a valiant man and a fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A neighbour ill for thy father, if a foe's name he must bear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the next is King Sigmund the Volsung of a land far over sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well thou knowest his kindred, and his might and his valiancy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tales of his heart of a God; and though old he be waxen now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet men deem that the wide world's blossom from Sigmund's loins shall grow."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said Hiordis: "I wot, my father, that hereof may strife arise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet soon spoken is mine answer; for I, who am called the wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I thrust by the praise of the people, and the tale that no ending hath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the love and the heart of the godlike, and the heavenward-leading path,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the rose and the stem of the lily, and the smooth-lipped youngling's kiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the eyes' desire that passeth, and the frail unstable bliss?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now shalt thou tell King Sigmund, that I deem it the crown of my life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dwell in the house of his fathers amidst all peace and strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to bear the sons of his body: and indeed full well I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fair from the loins of Sigmund shall such a stem outgrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all folk of the earth shall be praising the womb where once he lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the paps that his lips have cherished, and shall bless my happy day."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the king's heart sore misgave him, but herewith must he be content,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And great gifts to the earl of Lyngi and a word withal he sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the woman's troth was plighted to another people's king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But King Sigmund's earl on the morrow hath joyful yea-saying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ere two moons be perished he shall fetch his bride away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And bid him," King Eylimi sayeth, "to come with no small array,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with sword and shield and war-shaft, lest aught of ill betide."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So forth goes the earl of Sigmund across the sea-flood wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And comes to the land of the Volsungs, and meeteth Sigmund the king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tells how he sped on his errand, and the joyful yea-saying.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So King Sigmund maketh him ready, and they ride adown to the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All glorious of gear and raiment, and a goodly company.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet hath Sigmund thought of his father, and the deed he wrought before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hath scorn to gather his people and all his hosts of war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wend to the feast and the wedding: yet are their long-ships ten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the shielded folk aboard them are the mightiest men of men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Sigmund goeth a shipboard, and they hoist their sails to the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the beaks of the golden dragons leave the Volsungs' land behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then come they to Eylimi's kingdom, and good welcome have they there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when Sigmund looked on Hiordis, he deemed her wise and fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But her heart was exceeding fain when she saw the glorious king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it told her of times that should be full many a noble thing.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So there is Sigmund wedded at a great and goodly feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And day by day on Hiordis the joy of her heart increased;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her father joyed in Sigmund and his might and majesty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dead in the heart of the Isle-king his ancient fear did lie.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet, forsooth, had men looked seaward, they had seen the gathering cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the little wind arising, that should one day pipe so loud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For well may ye wot indeed that King Lyngi the Mighty is wroth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he getteth the gifts and the answer, and that tale of the woman's troth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he saith he will have the gifts and the woman herself withal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either for loving or hating, and that both those heads shall fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So now when Sigmund and Hiordis are wedded a month or more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Volsung bids men dight them to cross the sea-flood o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, how there cometh the tidings of measureless mighty hosts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who are gotten ashore from their long-ships on the skirts of King Eylimi's coasts.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sore boded the heart of the Isle-king of what the end should be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sigmund long beheld him, and he said: "Thou deem'st of me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That my coming hath brought thee evil; but put aside such things;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For long have I lived, and I know it, that the lives of mighty kings<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span><span class="i0">Are not cast away, nor drifted like the down before the wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And surely I know, who say it, that never would Hiordis' mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have been turned to wed King Lyngi or aught but the Volsung seed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, go we forth to the battle, that shall be the latest deed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thee and me meseemeth: yea, whether thou live or die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more shall the brand of Odin at peace in his scabbard lie."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And therewith he brake the peace-strings and drew the blade of bale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Death on the point abided, Fear sat on the edges pale.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So men ride adown to the sea-strand, and the kings their hosts array<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the high noon flooded heaven; and the men of the Volsungs lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With King Eylimi's shielded champions mid Lyngi's hosts of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the brown pips lie in the apple when ye cut it through the core.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But now when the kings were departed, from the King's house Hiordis went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And before men joined the battle she came to a woody bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where she lay with one of her maidens the death and the deeds to behold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the noon sun shone King Sigmund as an image all of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he stood before the foremost and the banner of his fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a thing he remembered, and he called on each earl by his name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To do well for the house of the Volsungs, and the ages yet unborn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he tossed up the sword of the Branstock, and blew on his father's horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dread of so many a battle, doom-song of so many a man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all the earth seemed moving as the hosts of Lyngi ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the Volsung men and the Isle-folk like wolves upon the prey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sore was their labour and toil ere the end of their harvesting day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On went the Volsung banners, and on went Sigmund before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his sword was the flail of the tiller on the wheat of the wheat-thrashing floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his shield was rent from his arm, and his helm was sheared from his head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But who may draw nigh him to smite for the heap and the rampart of dead?<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span><span class="i0">White went his hair on the wind like the ragged drift of the cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his dust-driven, blood-beaten harness was the death-storm's angry shroud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the summer sun is departing in the first of the night of wrack;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his sword was the cleaving lightning, that smites and is hurried aback<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere the hand may rise against it; and his voice was the following thunder.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then cold grew the battle before him, dead-chilled with the fear and the wonder:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For again in his ancient eyes the light of victory gleamed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his mouth grown tuneful and sweet the song of his kindred streamed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no more was he worn and weary, and no more his life seemed spent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with all the hope of his childhood was his wrath of battle blent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he thought: A little further, and the river of strife is passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I shall sit triumphant the king of the world at last.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But lo, through the hedge of the war-shafts a mighty man there came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One-eyed and seeming ancient, but his visage shone like flame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleaming-grey was his kirtle, and his hood was cloudy blue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he bore a mighty twi-bill, as he waded the fight-sheaves through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood face to face with Sigmund, and upheaved the bill to smite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more round the head of the Volsung fierce glittered the Branstock's light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sword that came from Odin; and Sigmund's cry once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang out to the very heavens above the din of war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then clashed the meeting edges with Sigmund's latest stroke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in shivering shards fell earthward that fear of worldly folk.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But changed were the eyes of Sigmund, and the war-wrath left his face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that grey-clad mighty helper was gone, and in his place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drave on the unbroken spear-wood 'gainst the Volsung's empty hands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there they smote down Sigmund, the wonder of all lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the foemen, on the death-heap his deeds had piled that day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ill hour for Sigmund's fellows! they fall like the seeded hay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the brown scythes' sweeping, and there the Isle-king fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the fore-front of his battle, wherein he wrought right well,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span><span class="i0">And soon they were nought but foemen who stand upon their feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the isle-strand by the ocean where the grass and the sea-sand meet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now hath the conquering War-king another deed to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he saith: "Who now gainsayeth King Lyngi come to woo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lord and the overcomer and the bane of the Volsung kin?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he fares to the Isle-king's dwelling a wife of the kings to win;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the host is gathered together, and they leave the field of the dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round as a targe of the Goth-folk the moon ariseth red.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so when the last is departed, and she deems they will come not aback,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fares Hiordis forth from the thicket to the field of the fateful wrack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And half-dead was her heart for sorrow as she waded the swathes of the sword.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not far did she search the death-field ere she found her king and lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the heap that his glaive had fashioned: not yet was his spirit past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though his hurts were many and grievous, and his life-blood ebbing fast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glad were his eyes and open as her wan face over him hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"Thou art sick with sorrow, and I would thou wert not so young;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet as my days passed shall thine pass; and a short while now it seems<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since my hand first gripped the sword-hilt, and my glory was but in dreams."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And now do I live but to tell thee of the days that are yet to come:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The shards of a glaive of battle that was once the best of the good:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take them and keep them surely. I have lived no empty days;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now these shards have been my fellow in the work the Gods would have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But today hath Odin taken the gift that once he gave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have wrought for the Volsungs truly, and yet have I known full well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That a better one than I am shall bear the tale to tell:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Under thy girdle he lieth, and how shall I say unto thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto thee, the wise of women, to cherish him heedfully.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, wife, put by thy sorrow for the little day we have had;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in sooth I deem thou weepest: The days have been fair and glad:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our valour and wisdom have met, and thou knowest they shall not die:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet and good were the days, nor yet to the Fates did we cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a little longer yet, and a little longer to live:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we took, we twain in our meeting, all gifts that they had to give:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our wisdom and valour have kissed, and thine eyes shall see the fruit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the joy for his days that shall be hath pierced mine heart to the root.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grieve not for me; for thou weepest that thou canst not see my face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How its beauty is not departed, nor the hope of mine eyes grown base.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indeed I am waxen weary; but who heedeth weariness<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then a long way over the sea-flood the day began to break;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the sun was arisen a little he turned his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the low beams bathed his eyen, and there lay Sigmund dead.<br /></span>

<h4>How King Sigmund the Volsung was laid in mound on the sea-side of
the Isle-realm.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Hiordis looked from the dead, and her eyes strayed down to the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a shielded ship she saw, and a war-dight company,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who beached the ship for the landing: so swift she fled away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once more to the depth of the thicket, wherein her handmaid lay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she said: "I have left my lord, and my lord is dead and gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he gave me a charge full heavy, and here are we twain alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And earls from the sea are landing: give me thy blue attire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take my purple and gold and my crown of the sea-flood's fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be thou the wife of King Volsung when men of our names shall ask,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will be the handmaid: now I bid thee to this task,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I pray thee not to fail me, because of thy faith and truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And because I have ever loved thee, and thy mother fostered my youth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, because my womb is wealthy with a gift for the days to be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now do this deed for mine asking and the tale shall be told of thee."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the other nought gainsaith it and they shift their raiment there:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But well-spoken was the maiden, and a woman tall and fair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the lord of those new-coming men was a king and the son of a king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Elf the son of the Helper, and he sailed from war-faring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drew anigh to the Isle-realm and sailed along the strand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the shipmen needed water and fain would go a-land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And King Elf stood hard by the tiller while the world was yet a-cold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the red sun lit the dawning, and they looked, and lo, behold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wrack of a mighty battle, and heaps of the shielded dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a woman alive amidst them, a queen with crown&egrave;d head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her eyes strayed down to the sea-strand, and she saw that weaponed folk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turned and fled to the thicket: then the lord of the shipmen spoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Lo, here shall we lack for water, for the brooks with blood shall run,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span><span class="i0">Yet wend we ashore to behold it and to wot of the deeds late done."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they turned their faces to Sigmund, and waded the swathes of the sword.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O, look ye long," said the Sea-king, "for here lieth a mighty lord:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all these are the deeds of his war-flame, yet hardy hearts, be sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they once durst look in his face or the wrath of his eyen endure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though his lips be glad and smiling as a God that dreameth of mirth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would God I were one of his kindred, for none such are left upon earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now fare we into the thicket, for thereto is the woman fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And belike she shall tell us the story of this field of the mighty dead."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they wend and find the women, and bespeak them kind and fair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then spake the gold-crowned handmaid: "Of the Isle-king's house we were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I am the Queen called Hiordis; and the man that lies on the field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was mine own lord Sigmund the Volsung, the mightiest under shield."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then all amazed were the sea-folk when they hearkened to that word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And great and heavy tidings they deem their ears have heard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But again spake out the Sea-king: "And this blue-clad one beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So pale, and as tall as a Goddess, and white and lovely eyed?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In sooth and in troth," said the woman, "my serving-maid is this;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She hath wept long over the battle, and sore afraid she is."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the king looks hard upon her, but he saith no word thereto,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down again to the death-field with the women-folk they go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There they set their hands to the labour, and amidst the deadly mead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They raise a mound for Sigmund, a mighty house indeed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therein they set that folk-king, and goodly was his throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dight with gold and scarlet: and the walls of the house were done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the cloven shields of the foemen, and banners borne to field;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But none might find his war-helm or the splinters of his shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clenched and fast was his right hand, but no sword therein he had:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span><span class="i0">For Hiordis spake to the shipmen:<br /></span>
<span class="i14">"Our lord and master bade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the shards of his glaive of battle should go with our lady the Queen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by them that lie a-dying a many things are seen."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So there lies Sigmund the Volsung, and far away, forlorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are the blossomed boughs of the Branstock, and the house where he was born.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what end was wrought that roof-ridge, and the rings of the silver door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fair-carved golden high-seat, and the many-pictured floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worn down by the feet of the Volsungs? or the hangings of delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the marvel of its harp-strings, or the Dwarf-wrought beakers bright?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the Gods have fashioned a folk who have fashioned a house in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is nought, and for nought they battled, and nought was their joy and their pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, the noble oak of the forest with his feet in the flowers and grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How the winds that bear the summer o'er its topmost branches pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wood-deer dwell beneath it, and the fowl in its fair twigs sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there it stands in the forest, an exceeding glorious thing:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then come the axes of men, and low it lies on the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the crane comes out of the southland, and its nest is nowhere found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bare and shorn of its blossoms is the house of the deer of the wood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the tree is a golden dragon; and fair it floats on the flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beareth the kings and the earl-folk, and is shield-hung all without:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it seeth the blaze of the beacons, and heareth the war-God's shout.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are tidings wherever it cometh, and the tale of its time shall be told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dear name it hath got like a king, and a fame that groweth not old.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lo, such is the Volsung dwelling; lo, such is the deed he hath wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who laboured all his life-days, and had rest but little or nought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who died in the broken battle; who lies with swordless hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the realm that the foe hath conquered on the edge of a stranger-land.<br /></span>

<h4>Of the birth of Sigurd the son of Sigmund.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Peace lay on the land of the Helper and the house of Elf his son;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There merry men went bedward when their tide of toil was done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glad was the dawn's awakening, and the noon-tide fair and glad:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There no great store had the franklin, and enough the hireling had;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a child might go unguarded the length and breadth of the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a purse of gold at his girdle and gold rings on his hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas a country of cunning craftsmen, and many a thing they wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the lands of storm desired, and the homes of warfare sought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But men deemed it o'er-well warded by more than its stems of fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And told how its earth-born watchers yet lived of plenteous might.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So hidden was that country, and few men sailed its sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none came o'er its mountains of men-folk's company.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fair-fruited, many-peopled, it lies a goodly strip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt the mountains cloudy-headed and the sea-flood's surging lip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a perilous flood is its ocean, and its mountains, who shall tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What things in their dales deserted and their wind-swept heaths may dwell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now a man of the Kings, called Gripir, in this land of peace abode:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The son of the Helper's father, though never lay his load<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span><span class="i0">In the womb of the mother of Kings that the Helper's brethren bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of Giant kin was his mother, of the folk that are seen no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though whiles as ye ride some fell-road across the heath there comes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The voice of their lone lamenting o'er their changed and conquered homes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long way off from the sea-strand and beneath the mountains' feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the high-built hall of Gripir, where the waste and the tillage meet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A noble and plentiful house, that a little men-folk fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But beloved of the crag-dwelling eagles and the kin of the woodland deer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man of few words was Gripir, but he knew of all deeds that had been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And times there came upon him, when the deeds to be were seen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sword had he held in his hand since his father fell to field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And against the life of the slayer he bore undinted shield:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet no fear in his heart abided, nor desired he aught at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he noted the deeds that had been, and looked for what should befall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Again, in the house of the Helper there dwelt a certain man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beardless and low of stature, of visage pinched and wan:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So exceeding old was Regin, that no son of man could tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In what year of the days passed over he came to that land to dwell:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the youth of King Elf had he fostered, and the Helper's youth thereto,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea and his father's father's: the lore of all men he knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was deft in every cunning, save the dealings of the sword:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sweet was his tongue-speech fashioned, that men trowed his every word;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hand with the harp-strings blended was the mingler of delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the latter days of sorrow; all tales he told aright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Master of the Masters in the smithying craft was he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he dealt with the wind and the weather and the stilling of the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor might any learn him leech-craft, for before that race was made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that man-folk's generation, all their life-days had he weighed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In this land abideth Hiordis amid all people's praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till cometh the time appointed: in the fulness of the days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the dark and the dusk she travailed, till at last in the dawning hour<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span><span class="i0">Have the deeds of the Volsungs blossomed, and born their latest flower;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the bed there lieth a man-child, and his eyes look straight on the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo, the hope of the people, and the days of a king are begun.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Men say of the serving-women, when they cried on the joy of the morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they handled the linen raiment, and washed the king new-born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they bore him back unto Hiordis, and the weary and happy breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade her be glad to behold it, how the best was sprung from the best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet they shrank in their rejoicing before the eyes of the child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So bright and dreadful were they; yea though the spring morn smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a thousand birds were singing round the fair familiar home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still as on other mornings they saw folk go and come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the hour seemed awful to them, and the hearts within them burned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though of fateful matters their souls were newly learned.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Hiordis looked on the Volsung, on her grief and her fond desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hope of her heart was quickened, and her joy was a living fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she said: "Now one of the earthly on the eyes of my child hath gazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor shrunk before their glory, nor stayed her love amazed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I behold thee as Sigmund beholdeth,&mdash;and I was the home of thine heart&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woe's me for the day when thou wert not, and the hour when we shall part!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she held him a little season on her weary and happy breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she told him of Sigmund and Volsung and the best sprung forth from the best:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She spake to the new-born baby as one who might understand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And told him of Sigmund's battle, and the dead by the sea-flood's strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of all the wars passed over, and the light with darkness blent.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So she spake, and the sun rose higher, and her speech at last was spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she gave him back to the women to bear forth to the people's kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they too may rejoice in her glory and her day of happy things.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But there sat the Helper of Men with King Elf and his Earls in the hall,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span><span class="i0">And they spake of the deeds that had been, and told of the times to befall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they hearkened and heard sweet voices and the sound of harps draw nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till their hearts were exceeding merry and they knew not wherefore or why:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, lo, in the hall white raiment, as thither the damsels came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And amid the hands of the foremost was the woven gold aflame.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O daughters of earls," said the Helper, "what tidings then do ye bear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it grief in the merry morning, or joy or wonder or fear?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth the first: "It is grief for the foemen that the Masters of God-home would grieve."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said the next: "'Tis a wonder of wonders, that the hearkening world shall believe."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A fear of all fears," said the third, "for the sword is uplifted on men."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A joy of all joys," said the fourth, "once come, and it comes not again!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lo, son," said the ancient Helper, "glad sit the earls and the lords!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lookst thou not for a token of tidings to follow such-like words?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Saith King Elf: "Great words of women! or great hath our dwelling become."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said the women: "Words shall be greater, when all folk shall praise our home."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What then hath betid," said King Elf, "do the high Gods stand in our gate?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nay," said they, "else were we silent, and they should be telling of fate."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Is the bidding come," said the Helper, "that we wend the Gods to see?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Many summers and winters," they said, "ye shall live on the earth, it may be."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said a young man: "Will ye be telling that all we shall die no more?"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nay," they answered, "nay, who knoweth but the change may be hard at the door?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come ships from the sea," said an elder, "with all gifts of the Eastland gold?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Was there less than enough," said the women, "when last our treasure was told?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Speak then," said the ancient Helper, "let the worst and the best be said."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth they: "'Tis the Queen of the Isle-folk, she is weary-sick on her bed."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said King Elf: "Yet ye come rejoicing; what more lieth under the tongue?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They said: "The earth is weary: but the tender blade hath sprung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shall wax till beneath its branches fair bloom the meadows green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the Gods and they that were mighty were glad erewhile with the Queen."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said King Elf: "How say ye, women? Of a King new-born do ye tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By a God of the Heavens begotten in our fathers' house to dwell?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"By a God of the Earth," they answered; "but greater yet is the son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though long were the days of Sigmund, and great are the deeds he hath done."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she with the golden burden to the kingly high-seat stepped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And away from the new-born baby the purple cloths she swept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried: "O King of the people, long mayst thou live in bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As our hearts today are happy! Queen Hiordis sends thee this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she saith that the world shall call it by the name that thou shalt name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the gift to thee is given, and to thee is brought the fame."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then e'en as a man astonied King Elf the Volsung took,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While his feast-hall's ancient timbers with the cry of the earl-folk shook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the eyes of the child gleamed on him till he was as one who sees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very Gods arising mid their carven images:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To his ears there came a murmur of far seas beneath the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tramp of fierce-eyed warriors through the outland forest blind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sound of hosts of battle, cries round the hoisted shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low talk of the gathered wise-ones in the Goth-folk's holy field:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the thought in a little moment through King Elf the mighty ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the years and their building and burden, and toil of the sons of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joy of folk and their sorrow, and the hope of deeds to do:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the love of many peoples was the wise king smitten through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he hung o'er the new-born Volsung: but at last he raised his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looked forth kind o'er his people, and spake aloud and said:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Sigmund King of Battle; O man of many days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom I saw mid the shields of the fallen and the dead men's silent praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, how hath the dark tide perished and the dawn of day begun!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, O mighty Sigmund, wherewith shall we name thy son?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But there rose up a man most ancient, and he cried: "Hail Dawn of the Day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many things shalt thou quicken, how many shalt thou slay!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many things shalt thou waken, how many lull to sleep!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many things shalt thou scatter, how many gather and keep!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O me, how thy love shall cherish, how thine hate shall wither and burn!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How the hope shall be sped from thy right hand, nor the fear to thy left return!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O thy deeds that men shall sing of! O thy deeds that the Gods shall see!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O SIGURD, Son of the Volsungs, O Victory yet to be!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Men heard the name and they knew it, and they caught it up in the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it went abroad by the windows and the doors of the feast-hall fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It went through street and market; o'er meadow and acre it went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over the wind-stirred forest and the dearth of the sea-beat bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over the sea-flood's welter, till the folk of the fishers heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hearts of the isle-abiders on the sun-scorched rocks were stirred.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the Queen in her golden chamber, the name she hearkened and knew<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span><span class="i0">And she heard the flock of the women, as back to the chamber they drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the name of Sigurd entered, and the body of Sigurd was come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it was as if Sigmund were living and she still in her lovely home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all folk of the world was she well, and a soul fulfilled of rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As alone in the chamber she wakened and Sigurd cherished her breast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But men feast in the merry noontide, and glad is the April green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That a Volsung looks on the sunlight and the night and the darkness have been.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earls think of marvellous stories, and along the golden strings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flit words of banded brethren and names of war-fain Kings:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the days of the deeds of Sigmund who was born so long ago;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All deeds of the glorious Signy, and her tarrying-tide of woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men tell of the years of Volsung, and how long agone it was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he changed his life in battle, and brought the tale to pass:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then goeth the word of the Giants, and the world seems waxen old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the dimness of King Rerir and the tale of his warfare told:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet unhushed are the singers' voices, nor yet the harp-strings cease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While yet is left a rumour of the mirk-wood's broken peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of Sigi the very ancient, and the unnamed Sons of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the days when the Lords of Heaven full oft the world-ways trod.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So stilleth the wind in the even and the sun sinks down in the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men abide the morrow and the Victory yet to be.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>Sigurd getteth to him the horse that is called Greyfell.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now waxeth the son of Sigmund in might and goodliness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soft the days win over, and all men his beauty bless.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But amidst the summer season was the Isle-queen Hiordis wed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To King Elf the son of the Helper, and fair their life-days sped.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace lay on the land for ever, and the fields gave good increase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there was Sigurd waxing mid the plenty and the peace.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now hath the child grown greater, and is keen and eager of wit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And full of understanding, and oft hath he joy to sit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid talk of weighty matters when the wise men meet for speech;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joyous he is moreover and blithe and kind with each.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Regin the wise craftsmaster heedeth the youngling well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And before the Kings he cometh, and saith such words to tell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I have fostered thy youth, King Elf, and thine O Helper of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ye wot that such a master no king shall see again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now would I foster Sigurd; for, though he be none of thy blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mine heart of his days that shall be speaketh abundant good."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then spake the Helper of men-folk: "Yea, do herein thy will:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thou art the Master of Masters, and hast learned me all my skill:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But think how bright is this youngling, and thy guile from him withhold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this craft of thine hath shown me that thy heart is grim and cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though three men's lives thrice over thy wisdom might not learn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I love this son of Sigmund, and mine heart to him doth yearn."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Regin laughed, and answered: "I doled out cunning to thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nought with him will I measure: yet no cold-heart shall he be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor grim, nor evil-natured: for whate'er my will might frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gone forth is the word of the Norns, that abideth ever the same.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, despite my cunning, how deem ye I shall die?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And they said he would live as he listed, and at last in peace should lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he listed to live no longer; so mighty and wise he was.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But again he laughed and answered: "One day it shall come to pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That a beardless youth shall slay me: I know the fateful doom;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nought may I withstand it, as it heaves up dim through the gloom."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So is Sigurd now with Regin, and he learns him many things;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span><span class="i0">Yea, all save the craft of battle, that men learned the sons of kings:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smithying sword and war-coat; the carving runes aright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tongues of many countries, and soft speech for men's delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dealing with the harp-strings, and the winding ways of song.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So wise of heart waxed Sigurd, and of body wondrous strong:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he chased the deer of the forest, and many a wood-wolf slew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a bull of the mountains: and the desert dales he knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the heaths that the wind sweeps over; and seaward would he fare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far out from the outer skerries, and alone the sea-wights dare.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On a day he sat with Regin amidst the unfashioned gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the silver grey from the furnace; and Regin spake and told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet tales of the days that have been, and the Kings of the bold and wise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the lad's heart swelled with longing and lit his sunbright eyes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Regin looked upon him: "Thou too shalt one day ride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the Volsung Kings went faring through the noble world and wide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this land is nought and narrow, and Kings of the carles are these.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their earls are acre-biders, and their hearts are dull with peace."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Sigurd knit his brows, and in wrathful wise he said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ill words of those thou speakest that my youth have cherished.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the friends that have made me merry, and the land that is fair and good."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Regin laughed and answered: "Nay, well I see by thy mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wide wilt thou ride in the world like thy kin of the earlier days:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wilt thou be wroth with thy master that he longs for thy winning the praise?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now if the sooth thou sayest, that these King-folk cherish thee well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then let them give thee a gift whereof the world shall tell:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea hearken to this my counsel, and crave for a battle-steed."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet wroth was the lad and answered: "I have many a horse to my need,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all that the heart desireth, and what wouldst thou wish me more?"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Regin answered and said: "Thy kin of the Kings of yore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were the noblest men of men-folk; and their hearts would never rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatso of good they had gotten, if their hands held not the best.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now do thou after my counsel, and crave of thy fosterers here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou choose of the horses of Gripir whichso thine heart holds dear."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He spake and his harp was with him, and he smote the strings full sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sang of the host of the Valkyrs, how they ride the battle to meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dew from the dear manes drippeth as they ride in the first of the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tree-boughs open to meet it when the wind of the dawning is done:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the deep dales drink its sweetness and spring into blossoming grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the earth groweth fruitful of men, and bringeth their glory to pass.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the wrath ran off from Sigurd, and he left the smithying stead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the song yet rang in the doorway: and that eve to the Kings he said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Will ye do so much for mine asking as to give me a horse to my will?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For belike the days shall come, that shall all my heart fulfill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And teach me the deeds of a king."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">Then answered King Elf and spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The stalls of the Kings are before thee to set aside or to take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nought we begrudge thee the best."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">Yet answered Sigurd again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his heart of the mountains aloft and the windy drift was fain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Fair seats for the knees of Kings! but now do I ask for a gift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as all the world shall be praising, the best of the strong and the swift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye shall give me a token for Gripir, and bid him to let me choose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From out of the noble stud-beasts that run in his meadow loose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if overmuch I have asked you, forget this prayer of mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deem the word unspoken, and get ye to the wine."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then smiled King Elf, and answered: "A long way wilt thou ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where unpeace and troubles and the griefs of the soul abide,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span><span class="i0">Yea unto the death at the last: yet surely shalt thou win<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The praise of many a people: so have thy way herein.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsooth no more may we hold thee than the hazel copse may hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun of the early dawning, that turneth it all unto gold."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then sweetly Sigurd thanked them; and through the night he lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mid dreams of many a matter till the dawn was on the way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he shook the sleep from off him, and that dwelling of Kings he left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wended his ways unto Gripir. On a crag from the mountain reft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was the house of the old King builded; and a mighty house it was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though few were the sons of men that over its threshold would pass:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the wild ernes cried about it, and the vultures toward it flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the winds from the heart of the mountains searched every chamber through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And about were meads wide-spreading; and many a beast thereon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea some that are men-folk's terror, their sport and pasture won.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So into the hall went Sigurd; and amidst was Gripir set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a chair of the sea-beast's tooth; and his sweeping beard nigh met<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The floor that was green as the ocean, and his gown was of mountain-gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the kingly staff in his hand was knobbed with the crystal cold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the first of the twain spake Gripir: "Hail King with the eyen bright!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nought needest thou show the token, for I know of thy life and thy light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no need to tell of thy message; it was wafted here on the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou wouldst be coming to-day a horse in my meadow to find:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strong must he be for the bearing of those deeds of thine that shall be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now choose thou of all the way-wearers that are running loose in my lea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be glad as thine heart will have thee and the fate that leadeth thee on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I bid thee again come hither when the sword of worth is won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy loins are girt for thy going on the road that before thee lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a glimmering over its darkness is come before mine eyes."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then again gat Sigurd outward, and adown the steep he ran<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span><span class="i0">And unto the horse-fed meadow: but lo, a grey-clad man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One-eyed and seeming-ancient, there met him by the way:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he spake: "Thou hastest, Sigurd; yet tarry till I say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A word that shall well bestead thee: for I know of these mountains well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the lea of Gripir, and the beasts that thereon dwell."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wouldst thou have red gold for thy tidings? art thou Gripir's horse-herd then?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay sure, for thy face is shining like the battle-eager men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My master Regin tells of: and I love thy cloud-grey gown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy visage gleams above it like a thing my dreams have known."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nay whiles have I heeded the horse-kind," then spake that elder of days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And sooth do the sages say, when the beasts of my breeding they praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is one thereof in the meadow, and, wouldst thou cull him out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt follow an elder's counsel, who hath brought strange things about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hath known thy father aforetime, and other kings of thy kin."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So Sigurd said, "I am ready; and what is the deed to win?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He said: "We shall drive the horses adown to the water-side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That cometh forth from the mountains, and note what next shall betide."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the twain sped on together, and they drave the horses on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they came to a rushing river, a water wide and wan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the white mews hovered o'er it; but none might hear their cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the rush and the rattle of waters, as the downlong flood swept by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the whole herd took the river and strove the stream to stem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a brave steed was there; but the flood o'ermastered them:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some, it swept them down-ward, and some won back to bank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some, caught by the net of the eddies, in the swirling hubbub sank;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one of all swam over, and they saw his mane of grey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toss over the flowery meadows, a bright thing far away:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wide then he wheeled about them, then took the stream again<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span><span class="i0">And with the waves' white horses mingled his cloudy mane.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then spake the elder of days: "Hearken now, Sigurd, and hear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time was when I gave thy father a gift thou shalt yet deem dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this horse is a gift of my giving:&mdash;heed nought where thou mayst ride:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I have seen thy fathers in a shining house abide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on earth they thought of its threshold, and the gifts I had to give;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor prayed for a little longer, and a little longer to live."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then forth he strode to the mountains, and fain was Sigurd now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ask him many a matter: but dim did his bright shape grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a man from the litten doorway fades into the dusk of night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sun in the high-noon shone, and the world was exceeding bright.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So Sigurd turned to the river and stood by the wave-wet strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the grey horse swims to his feet and lightly leaps aland,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the youngling looks upon him, and deems none beside him good.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And indeed, as tells the story, he was come of Sleipnir's blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tireless horse of Odin: cloud-grey he was of hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it seemed as Sigurd backed him that Sigmund's son he knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So glad he went beneath him. Then the youngling's song arose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he brushed through the noon-tide blossoms of Gripir's mighty close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he singeth the song of Greyfell, the horse that Odin gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who swam through the sweeping river, and back through the toppling wave.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>Regin telleth Sigurd of his kindred, and of the Gold that was accursed
from ancient days.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now yet the days pass over, and more than words may tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grows Sigurd strong and lovely, and all children love him well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oft he looks on the mountains and many a time is fain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To know of what lies beyond them, and learn of the wide world's gain.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span><span class="i0">And he saith: "I dwell in a land that is ruled by none of my blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my mother's sons are waxing, and fair kings shall they be and good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their servant or their betrayer&mdash;not one of these will I be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet needs must I wait for a little till Odin calls for me."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now again it happed on a day that he sat in Regin's hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hearkened many tidings of what had chanced to fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of kings that sought their kingdoms o'er many a waste and wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at last saith the crafty master:<br /></span>
<span class="i14">"Thou art King Sigmund's child:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou wait till these kings of the carles shall die in a little land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or wilt thou serve their sons and carry the cup to their hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or abide in vain for the day that never shall come about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When their banners shall dance in the wind and shake to the war-gods' shout?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd answered and said: "Nought such do I look to be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou, a deedless man, too much thou eggest me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these folk are good and trusty, and the land is lovely and sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in rest and in peace it lieth as the floor of Odin's feet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I know that the world is wide, and filled with deeds unwrought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for e'en such work was I fashioned, lest the songcraft come to nought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the harps of God-home tinkle, and the Gods are at stretch to hearken:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest the hosts of the Gods be scanty when their day hath begun to darken,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the bonds of the Wolf wax thin, and Loki fretteth his chain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sure for the house of my fathers full oft my heart is fain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And meseemeth I hear them talking of the day when I shall come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of all the burden of deeds, that my hand shall bear them home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so when the deed is ready, nowise the man shall lack:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the wary foot is the surest, and the hasty oft turns back."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then answered Regin the guileful: "The deed is ready to hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet holding my peace is the best, for well thou lovest the land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou lovest thy life moreover, and the peace of thy youthful days,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span><span class="i0">And why should the full-fed feaster his hand to the rye-bread raise?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet they say that Sigmund begat thee and he looked to fashion a man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear nought; he lieth quiet in his mound by the sea-waves wan."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So shone the eyes of Sigurd, that the shield against him hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cast back their light as the sunbeams; but his voice to the roof-tree rung:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Tell me, thou Master of Masters, what deed is the deed I shall do?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor mock thou the son of Sigmund lest the day of his birth thou rue."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then answered the Master of Sleight: "The deed is the righting of wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the quelling a bale and a sorrow that the world hath endured o'erlong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the winning a treasure untold, that shall make thee more than the kings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereof is the Helm of Aweing, the wonder of earthly things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thereof is its very fellow, the War-coat all of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That has not its like in the heavens, nor has earth of its fellow told."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then answered Sigurd the Volsung: "How long hereof hast thou known?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what unto thee is this treasure, that thou seemest to give as thine own?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Alas!" quoth the smithying master, "it is mine, yet none of mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since my heart herein avails not, and my hand is frail and fine&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is long since I first came hither to seek a man for my need;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I saw by a glimmering light that hence would spring the deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a deed of the world: but the generations passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the first of the days was as near to the end that I sought as the last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I looked on thine eyes in the cradle: and now I deem through thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the end of my days of waiting, and the end of my woes shall be."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd awhile was silent; but at last he answered and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou shalt have thy will and the treasure, and shalt take the curse on thine head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If a curse the gold enwrappeth: but the deed will I surely do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For today the dreams of my childhood hath bloomed in my heart anew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I long to look on the world and the glory of the earth<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span><span class="i0">And to deal in the dealings of men, and garner the harvest of worth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But tell me, thou Master of Masters, where lieth this measureless wealth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it guarded by swords of the earl-folk, or kept by cunning and stealth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it over the main sea's darkness, or beyond the mountain wall?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or e'en in these peaceful acres anigh to the hands of all?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Regin answered sweetly: "Hereof must a tale be told:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bide sitting, thou son of Sigmund, on the heap of unwrought gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hearken of wondrous matters, and of things unheard, unsaid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deeds of my beholding ere the first of Kings was made.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And first ye shall know of a sooth, that I never was born of the race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which the masters of God-home have made to cover the fair earth's face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I come of the Dwarfs departed; and fair was the earth whileome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere the short-lived thralls of the Gods amidst its dales were come:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how were we worse than the Gods, though maybe we lived not as long?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet no weight of memory maimed us; nor aught we knew of wrong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What felt our souls of shaming, what knew our hearts of love?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We did and undid at pleasure, and repented nought thereof.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For whiles can I scarcely think it that our days are wholly done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trust not thy life in my hands in the day when most I seem<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"So as we dwelt came tidings that the Gods amongst us were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the people came from Asgard: then rose up hope and fear,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And our sons waxed wild and wrathful, and our daughters learned to grieve.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then we fell to the working of metal, and the deeps of the earth would know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we dealt with venom and leechcraft, and we fashioned spear and bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we set the ribs to the oak-keel, and looked on the landless sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the world began to be such-like as the Gods would have it to be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the womb of the woeful earth had they quickened the grief and the gold.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And he saw through the shape of the Otter, and beheld a chief of his foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A king of the free and the careless: so he called up his baleful might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gathered his godhead together, and tore a shard outright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the rock-wall of the river, and across its green wells cast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And roaring over the waters that bolt of evil passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smote my brother Otter that his heart's life fled away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bore his man's shape with it, and beast-like there he lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stark dead on the sun-lit blossoms: but the Evil God rejoiced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And because of the sound of his singing the wild grew many-voiced.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then the three Gods waded the river, and no word H&aelig;nir spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his thoughts were set on God-home, and the day that is ever awake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Odin laughed in his wrath, and murmured: 'Ah, how long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the iron shall ring on the anvil for the shackles of thy wrong!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then Loki takes up the quarry, and is e'en as a man again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the three wend on through the wild-wood till they come to a grassy plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the untrodden mountains; and lo a noble house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a hall with great craft fashioned, and made full glorious;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But night on the earth was falling; so scantly might they see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wealth of its smooth-wrought stonework and its world of imagery:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Loki bade turn thither since day was at an end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And into that noble dwelling the lords of God-home wend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the porch was fair and mighty, and so smooth-wrought was its gold,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the marvels of its windows, and its golden hangings soft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the forest of its pillars! and each like the wave's heart shone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the mirrored boughs of the garden were dancing fair thereon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Long years agone was it builded, and where are its wonders now?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now the men of God-home marvelled, and gazed through the golden glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a man like a covetous king amidst of the hall they saw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his chair was the tooth of the whale, wrought smooth with never a flaw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his gown was the sea-born purple, and he bore a crown on his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never a sword was before him: kind-seeming words he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade rest to the weary feet that had worn the wild so long.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they sat, and were men by seeming; and there rose up music and song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they ate and drank and were merry: but amidst the glee of the cup<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They felt themselves tangled and caught, as when the net cometh up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the folk of the firth, and the main sea lieth far off;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the laughter of lips they hearkened, and that hall-abider's scoff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As his face and his mocking eyes anigh to their faces drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their godhead was caught in the net, and no shift of creation they knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To escape from their man-like bodies; so great that day was the Earth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then spake the hall-abider: 'Where then is thy guileful mirth,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ere the good and the evil wedded and begat the best and the worst.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how if today I undo it, that work of your fashioning,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And get ye back to your kingship and the driving on of the days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the day of the gathered war-hosts, and the tide of your Fateful Gloom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now nought may ye gainsay it that my mouth must speak the doom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ye wot well I am Reidmar, and that there ye lie red-hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the slaughtering of my offspring, and the spoiling of my land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his death of my wold hath bereft me and every highway wet.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"And there was I, I Regin, the smithier of the snare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And high up Fafnir towered with the brow that knew no fear,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor may ye be Gods henceforward save the rightful ransom be paid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But perchance ye are weary of kingship, and will deal no more with the earth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then curse the world, and depart, and sit in your changeless mirth;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"So spake Reidmar the Wise; but the wrath burned through his word,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And all these cried out together with the voice of the sea-storm's wrack;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'O hearken, Gods of the Goths! ye shall die, and we shall be Gods,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Time was when he knew of wisdom, and had many a tale to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the days before the Dwarf-age, and of what in that world befell:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he knew of the stars and the sun, and the worlds that come and go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the nether rim of heaven, and whence the wind doth blow,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My hands of old had builded; for I knew by many a sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the Fearful Face was my brother, that the blood of the Worm was mine.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then his eyelids fell, and he slumbered, and it seemed as Sigurd gazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the flames leapt up in the stithy and about the Master blazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his hand in the harp-strings wandered and the sweetness from them poured.<br /></span>

<h4>Of the forging of the Sword that is called The Wrath of Sigurd.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now again came Sigurd to Regin, and said: "Thou hast taught me a task<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereof none knoweth the ending: and a gift at thine hands I ask."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then answered Regin the Master: "The world must be wide indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If my hand may not reach across it for aught thine heart may need."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yea wide is the world," said Sigurd, "and soon spoken is thy word;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But this gift thou shalt nought gainsay me: for I bid thee forge me a sword."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then spake the Master of Masters, and his voice was sweet and soft:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Look forth abroad, O Sigurd, and note in the heavens aloft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How the dim white moon of the daylight hangs round as the Goth-God's shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now for thee first rang mine anvil when she walked the heavenly field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A slim and lovely lady, and the old moon lay on her arm:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, here is a sword I have wrought thee with many a spell and charm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the craft of the Dwarf-kind; be glad thereof and sure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mid many a storm of battle full well shall it endure."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd looked on the slayer, and never a word would speak:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gemmed were the hilts and golden, and the blade was blue and bleak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And runes of the Dwarf-kind's cunning each side the trench were scored:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soft and sweet spake Regin: "How likest thou the sword?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd laughed and answered: "The work is proved by the deed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See now if this be a traitor to fail me in my need."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Regin trembled and shrank, so bright his eyes outshone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he turned about to the anvil, and smote the sword thereon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the shards fell shivering earthward, and Sigurd's heart grew wroth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the steel-flakes tinkled about him: "Lo, there the right-hand's troth!<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span><span class="i0">Lo, there the golden glitter, and the word that soon is spilt."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down amongst the ashes he cast the glittering hilt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turned his back on Regin and strode out through the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for many a day of spring-tide came back again no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at last he came to the stithy and again took up the word:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What hast thou done, O Master, in the forging of the sword?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then sweetly Regin answered: "Hard task-master art thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lo, a blade of battle that shall surely please thee now!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two moons are clean departed since thou lookedst toward the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sawest the dim white circle amid the cloud-flecks lie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And night and day have I laboured; and the cunning of old days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath surely left my right-hand if this sword thou shalt not praise."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And indeed the hilts gleamed glorious with many a dear-bought stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down the fallow edges the light of battle shone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Sigurd's eyes shone brighter, nor yet might Regin face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those eyes of the heart of the Volsungs; but trembled in his place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Sigurd cried: "O Regin, thy kin of the days of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were an evil and treacherous folk, and they lied and murdered for gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now if thou wouldst betray me, of the ancient curse beware,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And set thy face as the flint the bale and the shame to bear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he that would win to the heavens, and be as the Gods on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must tremble nought at the road, and the place where men-folk die."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">White leaps the blade in his hand and gleams in the gear of the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he smites, and the oft-smitten edges on the beaten anvil fall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the life of the sword departed, and dull and broken it lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the ashes and flaked-off iron, and no word did Sigurd say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But strode off through the door of the stithy and went to the Hall of Kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was merry and blithe that even mid all imaginings.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But when the morrow was come he went to his mother and spake:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span><span class="i0">"The shards, the shards of the sword, that thou gleanedst for my sake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the night on the field of slaughter, in the tide when my father fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou kept them through sorrow and joyance? hast thou warded them trusty and well?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where hast thou laid them, my mother?"<br /></span>
<span class="i18">Then she looked upon him and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Art thou wroth, O Sigurd my son, that such eyes are in thine head?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wilt thou be wroth with thy mother? do I withstand thee at all?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nay," said he, "nought am I wrathful, but the days rise up like a wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt my soul and the deeds, and I strive to rend them through.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why wilt thou fear mine eyen? as the sword lies baleful and blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en 'twixt the lips of lovers, when they swear their troth thereon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So keen are the eyes ye have fashioned, ye folk of the days agone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For therein is the light of battle, though whiles it lieth asleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now give me the sword, my mother, that Sigmund gave thee to keep."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She said: "I shall give it thee gladly, for fain shall I be of thy praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou knowest my careful keeping of that hope of the earlier days."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So she took his hand in her hand, and they went their ways, they twain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they came to the treasure of queen-folk, the guarded chamber of gain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were all alone with its riches, and she turned the key in the gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lifted the sea-born purple, and the silken web unrolled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo, 'twixt her hands and her bosom the shards of Sigmund's sword;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No rust-fleck stained its edges, and the gems of the ocean's hoard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were as bright in the hilts and glorious, as when in the Volsungs' hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It shone in the eyes of the earl-folk and flashed from the shielded wall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Sigurd smiled upon it, and he said: "O Mother of Kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well hast thou warded the war-glaive for a mirror of many things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a hope of much fulfilment: well hast thou given to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The message of my fathers, and the word of thing to be:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trusty hath been thy warding, but its hour is over now:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span><span class="i0">These shards shall be knit together, and shall hear the war-wind blow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shall shine through the rain of Odin, as the sun come back to the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the heaviest bolt of the thunder amidst the storm is hurled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shall shake the thrones of Kings, and shear the walls of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And undo the knot of treason when the world is darkening o'er.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have shone in the dusk and the night-tide, they shall shine in the dawn and the day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have gathered the storm together, they shall chase the clouds away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have sheared red gold asunder, they shall gleam o'er the garnered gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have ended many a story, they shall fashion a tale to be told:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have lived in the wrack of the people; they shall live in the glory of folk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They have stricken the Gods in battle, for the Gods shall they strike the stroke."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she felt his hands about her as he took the fateful sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he kissed her soft and sweetly; but she answered never a word:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So great and fair was he waxen, so glorious was his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So young, as the deathless Gods are, that long in the golden place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stood when he was departed: as some for-travailed one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes over the dark fell-ridges on the birth-tide of the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his gathering sleep falls from him mid the glory and the blaze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he sees the world grow merry and looks on the lightened ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the ruddy streaks are melting in the day-flood broad and white;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the morn-dusk he forgetteth, and the moon-lit waste of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hall whence he departed with its yellow candles' flare:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So stood the Isle-king's daughter in that treasure-chamber fair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But swift on his ways went Sigurd, and to Regin's house he came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the Master stood in the doorway and behind him leapt the flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dark he looked and little: no more his speech was sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No words on his lip were gathered the Volsung child to greet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he took the sword from Sigurd and the shards of the days of old;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i6">"Will nothing serve thee save this blue steel and cold,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then answered the eye-bright Sigurd: "If thou thy craft wilt do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nought save these battle-gleanings shall be my helper true:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what if thou begrudgest, and my battle-blade be dull,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the hand of the Norns is lifted and the cup is over-full.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repentst thou ne'er so sorely that thy kin must lie alow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How much soe'er thou longest the world to overthrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, doubting the gold and the wisdom, wouldst even now appease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blind hate and eyeless murder, and win the world with these;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-late is the time for repenting the word thy lips have said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt have the Gold and the wisdom and take its curse on thine head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I say that thy lips have spoken, and no more with thee it lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To do the deed or leave it: since thou hast shown mine eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world that was aforetime, I see the world to be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And woe to the tangling thicket, or the wall that hindereth me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And short is the space I will tarry; for how if the Worm should die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere the first of my strokes be stricken? Wilt thou get to thy mastery<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knit these shards together that once in the Branstock stood?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if not and a smith's hands fail me, a king's hand yet shall be good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Norns have doomed thy brother. And yet I deem this sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the slayer of the Serpent, and the scatterer of the Hoard."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Great waxed the gloom of Regin, and he said: "Thou sayest sooth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For none may turn him backward: the sword of a very youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall one day end my cunning, as the Gods my joyance slew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When nought thereof they were deeming, and another thing would do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But this sword shall slay the Serpent; and do another deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many an one thereafter till it fail thee in thy need.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as fair and great as thou standeth, yet get thee from mine house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in me too might ariseth, and the place is perilous<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the craft that was aforetime, and shall never be again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the hands that have taught thee cunning have failed from the world of men.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span><span class="i0">Thou art wroth; but thy wrath must slumber till fate its blossom bear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not thus were the eyes of Odin when I held him in the snare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Depart! lest the end overtake us ere thy work and mine be done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But come again in the night-tide and the slumber of the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the sharded moon of April hangs round in the undark May."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hither and thither a while did the heart of Sigurd sway;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he feared no craft of the Dwarf-kind, nor heeded the ways of Fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his hand wrought e'en as his heart would: and now was he weary with hate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the hatred and scorn of the Gods, and the greed of gold and of gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the weaponless hands of the stripling of the wrath and the rending were fain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there stood Regin the Master, and his eyes were on Sigurd's eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though nought belike they beheld him, and his brow was sad and wise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the greed died out of his visage and he stood like an image of old.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the Norns drew Sigurd away, and the tide was an even of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet in the April even were the fowl-kind singing their best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the light of life smote Sigurd, and the joy that knows no rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fond unnamed desire, and the hope of hidden things;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he wended fair and lovely to the house of the feasting Kings.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But now when the moon was at full and the undark May begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went Sigurd unto Regin mid the slumber of the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And amidst the fire-hall's pavement the King of the Dwarf-kind stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like an image of deeds departed and days that once were good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he seemed but faint and weary, and his eyes were dim and dazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they met the glory of Sigurd where the fitful candles blazed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i6">"Hail, Son of the Volsungs, the corner-stone is laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have toiled and thou hast desired, and, lo, the fateful blade!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd saw it lying on the ashes slaked and pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the sun and the lightning mingled mid the even's cloudy bale,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span><span class="i0">For ruddy and great were the hilts, and the edges fine and wan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all adown to the blood-point a very flame there ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That swallowed the runes of wisdom wherewith its sides were scored.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sound did Sigurd utter as he stooped adown for his sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it seemed as his lips were moving with speech of strong desire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White leapt the blade o'er his head, and he stood in the ring of its fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As hither and thither it played, till it fell on the anvil's strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he cried aloud in his glory, and held out the sword full length,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one who would show it the world; for the edges were dulled no whit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the anvil was cleft to the pavement with the dreadful dint of it.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Regin cried to his harp-strings: "Before the days of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I smithied the Wrath of Sigurd, and now is it smithied again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my hand alone hath done it, and my heart alone hath dared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bid that man to the mountain, and behold his glory bared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, if the son of Sigmund might wot of the thing I would,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then how were the ages bettered, and the world all waxen good!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then how were the past forgotten and the weary days of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hope of man that dieth and the waste that never bore!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How should this one live through the winter and know of all increase!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How should that one spring to the sunlight and bear the blossom of peace!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more should the long-lived wisdom o'er the waste of the wilderness stray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the clear-eyed hero hasten to the deedless ending of day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what if the hearts of the Volsungs for this deed of deeds were born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How then were their life-days evil and the end of their lives forlorn?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There stood Sigurd the Volsung, and heard how the harp-strings rang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of other things they told him than the hope that the Master sang;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his world lay far away from the Dwarf-king's eyeless realm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the road that leadeth nowhere, and the ship without a helm:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he spake: "How oft shall I say it, that I shall work thy will?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If my father hath made me mighty, thine heart shall I fulfill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the wisdom and gold thou wouldest, before I wend on my ways;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span><span class="i0">For now hast thou failed me nought, and the sword is the wonder of days."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No word for a while spake Regin; but he hung his head adown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a man that pondereth sorely, and his voice once more was grown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the voice of the smithying-master as he spake: "This Wrath of thine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath cleft the hard and the heavy; it shall shear the soft and the fine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come forth to the night and prove it."<br /></span>
<span class="i14">So they twain went forth abroad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the moon lay white on the river and lit the sleepless ford,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down to its pools they wended, and the stream was swift and full;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Regin cast against it a lock of fine-spun wool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it whirled about on the eddy till it met the edges bared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as clean as the careless water the laboured fleece was sheared.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Regin spake: "It is good, what the smithying-carle hath wrought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the work of the King beginneth, and the end that my soul hath sought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt toil and I shall desire, and the deed shall be surely done:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thy Wrath is alive and awake and the story of bale is begun."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Therewith was the Wrath of Sigurd laid soft in a golden sheath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the peace-strings knit around it; for that blade was fain of death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'tis ill to show such edges to the broad blue light of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to let the hall-glare light them, if ye list not play the play.<br /></span>

<h4>Of Gripir's Foretelling.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Sigurd backeth Greyfell on the first of the morrow morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he rideth fair and softly through the acres of the corn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Wrath to his side is girded, but hid are the edges blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he wendeth his ways to the mountains, and rideth the horse-mead through.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wide grey eyes are happy, and his voice is sweet and soft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As amid the mead-lark's singing he casteth song aloft:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span><span class="i0">Lo, lo, the horse and the rider! So once maybe it was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When over the Earth unpeopled the youngest God would pass;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never again meseemeth shall such a sight betide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till over a world unwrongful new-born shall Baldur ride.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he comes to that ness of the mountains, and Gripir's garden steep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bravely Greyfell breasteth, and adown by the door doth he leap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his war-gear rattleth upon him; there is none to ask or forbid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he wendeth the house clear-lighted, where no mote of the dust is hid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the sunlight hath not entered: the walls are clear and bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they cast back each to other the golden Sigurd's light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the echoing ways of the house bright-eyed he wendeth along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the mountain-wind is with him, and the hovering eagles' song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no sound of the children of men may the ears of the Volsung hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no sign of their ways in the world, or their will, or their hope or their fear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he comes to the hall of Gripir, and gleaming-green is it built<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the house of under-ocean where the wealth of the greedy is spilt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleaming and green as the sea, and rich as its rock-strewn floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fresh as the autumn morning when the burning of summer is o'er.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There he looks and beholdeth the high-seat, and he sees it strangely wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the tooth of the sea-beast fashioned ere the Dwarf-kind came to nought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he looks, and thereon is Gripir, the King exceeding old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the sword of his fathers girded, and his raiment wrought of gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the ivory rod in his right-hand, with his left on the crystal laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is round as the world of men-folk, and after its image made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clear is it wrought to the eyen that may read therein of Fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though little indeed be its sea, and its earth not wondrous great.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There Sigurd stands in the hall, on the sheath&egrave;d Wrath doth he lean.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All his golden light is mirrored in the gleaming floor and green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the smile in his face upriseth as he looks on the ancient King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their glad eyes meet and their laughter, and sweet is the welcoming:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span><span class="i0">And Gripir saith: "Hail Sigurd! for my bidding hast thou done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here in the mountain-dwelling are two Kings of men alone."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Sigurd spake: "Hail father! I am girt with the fateful sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my face is set to the highway, and I come for thy latest word."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said Gripir: "What wouldst thou hearken ere we sit and drink the wine?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thy word and the Norns'," said Sigurd, "but never a word of mine."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What sights wouldst thou see," said Gripir, "ere mine hand shall take thine hand?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"As the Gods would I see," said Sigurd, "though Death light up the land."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What hope wouldst thou hope, O Sigurd, ere we kiss, we twain, and depart?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thy hope and the Gods'," said Sigurd, "though the grief lie hard on my heart."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nought answered the ancient wise-one, and not a whit had he stirred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since the clash of Sigurd's raiment in his mountain-hall he heard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the ball that imaged the earth was set in his hand grown old;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And belike it was to his vision, as the wide-world's ocean rolled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the forests waved with the wind, and the corn was gay with the lark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gold in its nether places grew up in the dusk and the dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its children built and departed, and its King-folk conquered and went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As over the crystal image his all-wise face was bent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all his desire was dead, and he lived as a God shall live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom the prayers of the world hath forgotten, and to whom no hand may give.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But there stood the mighty Volsung, and leaned on the hidden Wrath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the earliest sun's uprising o'er the sea-plain draws a path<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereby men sail to the Eastward and the dawn of another day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the image of King Sigurd on the gleaming pavement lay.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then great in the hall fair-pillared the voice of Gripir arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it ran through the glimmering house-ways, and forth to the sunny close;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There mid the birds' rejoicing went the voice of an o'er-wise King<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a wind of midmost winter come back to talk with spring.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the voice cried: "Sigurd, Sigurd! O great, O early born!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then Sigurd came unto Gripir, and he kissed the wise-one's face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they sat in the high-seat together, the child and the elder of days;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they drank of the wine of King-folk, and were joyful each of each,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spake for a while of matters that are meet for King-folk's speech;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deeds of men that have been and Kin of the Kings of the earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Gripir told of the outlands, and the mid-world's billowy girth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tales of the upper heaven were mingled with his talk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the halls where the Sea-Queen's kindred o'er the gem-strewn pavement walk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the innermost parts of the earth, where they lie, the green and the blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the red and the glittering gem-stones that of old the Dwarf-kind knew.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Long Sigurd sat and marvelled at the mouth that might not lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the eyes no God had blinded, and the lone heart raised on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he rose from the gleaming high-seat, and the rings of battle rang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sheath&egrave;d Wrath was hearkening and a song of war it sang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sigurd spake unto Gripir:<br /></span>
<span class="i14">"Long and lovely are thy days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy years fulfilled of wisdom, and thy feet on the unhid ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the guileless heart of the great that knoweth not anger nor pain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So once hath a man been fashioned and shall not be again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for me hath been foaled the war-horse, the grey steed swift as the cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for me were the edges smithied, and the Wrath cries out aloud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a voice hath called from the darkness, and I ride to the Glittering Heath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To smite on the door of Destruction, and waken the warder of Death."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they kissed, the wise and the wise, and the child from the elder turned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And again in the glimmering house-ways the golden Sigurd burned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stood outside in the sunlight, and tarried never a deal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But leapt on the cloudy Greyfell with the clank of gold and steel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he rode through the sinking day to the walls of the kingly stead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And came to Regin's dwelling when the wind was fallen dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the great sun just departing: then blood-red grew the west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fowl flew home from the sea-mead, and all things sank to rest.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Again on the morrow morning doth Sigurd the Volsung ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Regin, the Master of Masters, is faring by his side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they leave the dwelling of kings and ride the summer land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until at the eve of the day the hills are on either hand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they wend up higher and higher, and over the heaths they fare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the moon shines broad on the midnight, and they sleep 'neath the heavens bare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they waken and look behind them, and lo, the dawning of day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the little land of the Helper and its valleys far away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the mountains rise before them, a wall exceeding great.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then spake the Master of Masters: "We have come to the garth and the gate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is youth and rest behind thee and many a thing to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is many a fond desire, and each day born anew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the land of the Volsungs to conquer, and many a people's praise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for me there is rest it maybe, and the peaceful end of days.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have come to the garth and the gate; to the hall-door now shall we win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall we go to look on the high-seat and see what sitteth therein?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yea, and what else?" said Sigurd, "was thy tale but mockeries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have I been drifted hither on a wind of empty lies?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It was sooth, it was sooth," said Regin, "and more might I have told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had I heart and space to remember the deeds of the days of old."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And he hung down his head as he spake it, and was silent a little space;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when it was lifted again there was fear in the Dwarf-king's face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he said: "Thou knowest my thought, and wise-hearted art thou grown:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It were well if thine eyes were blinder, and we each were faring alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I with my eld and my wisdom, and thou with thy youth and thy might;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet whiles I dream I have wrought thee, a beam of the morning bright,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span><span class="i0">A fatherless motherless glory, to work out my desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then high my hope ariseth, and my heart is all afire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the world I behold from afar, and the day that yet shall be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I wake and all things I remember and a youth of the Kings I see&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;The child of the Wood-abider, the seed of a conquered King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sword that the Gods have fashioned, the fate that men shall sing:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah might the world run backward to the days of the Dwarfs of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I hewed out the pillars of crystal, and smoothed the walls of gold!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nought answered the Son of Sigmund; nay he heard him nought at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save as though the wind were speaking in the bights of the mountain-hall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he leapt aback of Greyfell, and the glorious sun rose up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the heavens glowed above him like the bowl of Baldur's cup,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a golden man was he waxen; as the heart of the sun he seemed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While over the feet of the mountains like blood the new light streamed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd cried to Greyfell and swift for the pass he rode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Regin followed after as a man bowed down by a load.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Day-long they fared through the mountains, and that highway's fashioner<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsooth was a fearful craftsman, and his hands the waters were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the heaped-up ice was his mattock, and the fire-blast was his man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never a whit he heeded though his walls were waste and wan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the guest-halls of that wayside great heaps of the ashes spent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, each as a man alone, through the sun-bright day they went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they rode till the moon rose upward, and the stars were small and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they slept on the long-slaked ashes beneath the heavens bare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cold dawn came and they wakened, and the King of the Dwarf-kind seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a thing of that wan land fashioned; but Sigurd glowed and gleamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the shadowless twilight by Greyfell's cloudy flank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a little space they abided while the latest star-world shrank;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the backward road looked Regin and heard how Sigurd drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The girths of Greyfell's saddle, and the voice of his sword he knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he feared to look on the Volsung, as thus he fell to speak:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I have seen the Dwarf-folk mighty, I have seen the God-folk weak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, though our might be minished, yet have we gifts to give.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When men desire and conquer, most sweet is their life to live;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When men are young and lovely there is many a thing to do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet is their fond desire and the dawn that springs anew."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This gift," said the Son of Sigmund, "the Norns shall give me yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no blossom slain by the sunshine while the leaves with dew are wet."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Regin turned and beheld him: "Thou shalt deem it hard and strange,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the hand hath encompassed it all, and yet thy life must change.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, long were the lives of men-folk, if betwixt the Gods and them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were mighty warders watching mid the earth's and the heaven's hem!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is there any man so mighty he would cast this gift away,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heart's desire accomplished, and life so long a day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the dawn should be forgotten ere the even was begun?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd laughed and answered: "Fare forth, O glorious sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright end from bright beginning, and the mid-way good to tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And death, and deeds accomplished, and all remembered well!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall the day go past and leave us, and we be left with night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tread the endless circle, and strive in vain to smite?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou&mdash;wilt thou still look backward? thou sayst I know thy thought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast whetted the sword for the slaying, it shall turn aside for nought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear not! with the Gold and the wisdom thou shalt deem thee God alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mayst do and undo at pleasure, nor be bound by right nor wrong:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, if no God I be waxen, I shall be the weak with the strong."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And his war-gear clanged and tinkled as he leapt to the saddle-stead:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sun rose up at their backs and the grey world changed to red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And away to the west went Sigurd by the glory wreathed about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But little and black was Regin as a fire that dieth out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Day-long they rode the mountains by the crags exceeding old,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span><span class="i0">And the ash that the first of the Dwarf-kind found dull and quenched and cold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the moon in the mid-sky swam, and the stars were fair and pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beneath the naked heaven they slept in an ash-grey dale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And again at the dawn-dusk's ending they stood upon their feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sigurd donned his war-gear nor his eyes would Regin meet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A clear streak widened in heaven low down above the earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And above it lay the cloud-flecks, and the sun, anigh its birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unseen, their hosts was staining with the very hue of blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ruddy by Greyfell's shoulder the Son of Sigmund stood.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then spake the Master of Masters: "What is thine hope this morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou dightest thee, O Sigurd, to ride this world forlorn?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What needeth hope," said Sigurd, "when the heart of the Volsungs turns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the light of the Glittering Heath, and the house where the Waster burns?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall slay the Foe of the Gods, as thou badst me a while agone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then with the Gold and its wisdom shalt thou be left alone."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Child," said the King of the Dwarf-kind, "when the day at last comes round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the dread and the Dusk of the Gods, and the kin of the Wolf is unbound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thy sword shall hew the fire, and the wildfire beateth thy shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shalt thou praise the wages of hope and the Gods that pitched the field?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Foe of the Gods," said Sigurd, "wouldst thou hide the evil thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the curse that is greater than thou, lest death end thy labouring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest the night should come upon thee amidst thy toil for nought?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is me, it is me that thou fearest, if indeed I know thy thought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea me, who would utterly light the face of all good and ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If not with the fruitful beams that the summer shall fulfill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then at least with the world a-blazing, and the glare of the grinded sword."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And he sprang aloft to the saddle as he spake the latest word,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span><span class="i0">And the Wrath sang loud in the sheath as it ne'er had sung before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cloudy flecks were scattered like flames on the heaven's floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all was kindled at once, and that trench of the mountains grey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was filled with the living light as the low sun lit the way:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Regin turned from the glory with blinded eyes and dazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo, on the cloudy war-steed how another light there blazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a great voice came from amidst it:<br /></span>
<span class="i14">"O Regin, in good sooth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have hearkened not nor heeded the words of thy fear and thy ruth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast told thy tale and thy longing, and thereto I hearkened well:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let it lead thee up to heaven, let it lead thee down to hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deed shall be done tomorrow: thou shalt have that measureless Gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And devour the garnered wisdom that blessed thy realm of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hath lain unspent and begrudged in the very heart of hate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the blood and the might of thy brother thine hunger shalt thou sate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this deed shall be mine and thine; but take heed for what followeth then!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let each do after his kind! I shall do the deeds of men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall harvest the field of their sowing, in the bed of their strewing shall sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To them shall I give my life-days, to the Gods my glory to keep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou with the wealth and the wisdom that the best of the Gods might praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou shalt indeed excel them and become the hope of the days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then me in turn hast thou conquered, and I shall be in turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy fashioned brand of the battle through good and evil to burn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the flame that sleeps in thy stithy for the gathered winds to blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou listest to do and undo and thine uttermost cunning to show.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But indeed I wot full surely that thou shalt follow thy kind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for all that cometh after, the Norns shall loose and bind."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then his bridle-reins rang sweetly, and the warding-walls of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Regin drew up to him, and the Wrath sang loud in the sheath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forth from that trench in the mountains by the westward way they ride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And little and black goes Regin by the golden Volsung's side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no more his head is drooping, for he seeth the Elf-king's Gold;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So up and up they journeyed, and ever as they went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the cold-slaked forges, o'er many a cloud-swept bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the walls of blackness, by shores of the fishless meres,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fathomless desert waters, did Regin cast his fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wrap him in desire; and all alone he seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a God to his heirship wending, and forgotten and undreamed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was all the tale of Sigurd, and the folk he had toiled among,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Volsungs, Odin's children, and the men-folk fair and young.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So on they ride to the westward; and huge were the mountains grown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the floor of heaven was mingled with that tossing world of stone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they rode till the noon was forgotten and the sun was waxen low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they tarried not, though he perished, and the world grew dark below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they rode a mighty desert, a glimmering place and wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And into a narrow pass high-walled on either side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the blackness of the mountains, and barred aback and in face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the empty night of the shadow; a windless silent place:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the white moon shone o'erhead mid the small sharp stars and pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And each as a man alone they rode on the highway of bale.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So ever they wended upward, and the midnight hour was o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the stars grew pale and paler, and failed from the heaven's floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the moon was a long while dead, but where was the promise of day?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No change came over the darkness, no streak of the dawning grey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sound of the wind's uprising adown the night there ran:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was blind as the Gaping Gulf ere the first of the worlds began.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then athwart and athwart rode Sigurd and sought the walls of the pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But found no wall before him; and the road rang hard as brass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the hoofs of Greyfell, as up and up he trod:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Was it the daylight of Hell, or the night of the doorway of God?<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But lo, at the last a glimmer, and a light from the west there came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And another and another, like points of far-off flame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they grew and brightened and gathered; and whiles together they ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the moon wake over the waters; and whiles they were scant and wan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some greater and some lesser, like the boats of fishers laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the sea of midnight; and a dusky dawn they made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A faint and glimmering twilight: So Sigurd strains his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he sees how a land deserted all round about him lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More changeless than mid-ocean, as fruitless as its floor:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the heart leaps up within him, for he knows that his journey is o'er.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there he draweth bridle on the first of the Glittering Heath:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Wrath is waxen merry and sings in the golden sheath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he leaps adown from Greyfell, and stands upon his feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wends his ways through the twilight the Foe of the Gods to meet.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So spake the Son of Sigmund, and beheld no man anear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And again was the night the midnight, and the twinkling flames shone clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the hush of the Glittering Heath; and alone went Sigmund's son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he came to the road of Fafnir, and the highway worn by one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the drift of the rain unfurrowed, by the windy years unrent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forth from the dark it came, and into the dark it went.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Great then was the heart of Sigurd, for there in the midmost he stayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought of the ancient fathers, and bared the bright blue blade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shone as a fleck of the day-light, and the night was all around.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair then was the Son of Sigmund as he tolled and laboured the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great, mighty he was in his working, and the Glittering Heath he clave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sword shone blue before him as he dug the pit and the grave:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There he hid his hope from the night-tide and lay like one of the dead,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the night wanes over Sigurd, and the ruddy rings he sees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his war-gear's fair adornment, and the God-folk's images;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a voice in the desert ariseth, a sound in the waste has birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A changing tinkle and clatter, as of gold dragged over the earth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er Sigurd widens the day-light, and the sound is drawing close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And speedier than the trample of speedy feet it goes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ever deemeth Sigurd that the sun brings back the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the grave grows lighter and lighter and heaven o'erhead is grey.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But now, how the rattling waxeth till he may not heed nor hark!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the day and the heavens are hidden, and o'er Sigurd rolls the dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the flood of a pitchy river, and heavy-thick is the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the venom of hate long hoarded, and lies once fashioned fair:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the lips are writhed with laughter and bleared are the blinded eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it wandereth hither and thither, and searcheth through the grave<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With red sword high uplifted, with wrathful glittering eyes;<br /></span>

<h4>Sigurd slayeth Regin the Master of Masters on the Glittering Heath.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There standeth Sigurd the Volsung, and leaneth on his sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beside him now is Greyfell and looks on his golden lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the world is awake and living; and whither now shall they wend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who have come to the Glittering Heath, and wrought that deed to its end?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For hither comes Regin the Master from the skirts of the field of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he shadeth his eyes from the sunlight as afoot he goeth and saith:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ah, let me live for a while! for a while and all shall be well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When passed is the house of murder and I creep from the prison of hell."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Afoot he went o'er the desert, and he came unto Sigurd and stared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the golden gear of the man, and the Wrath yet bloody and bared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the light locks raised by the wind, and the eyes beginning to smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lovely lips of the Volsung, and the brow that knew no guile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he murmured under his breath while his eyes grew white with wrath:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O who art thou, and wherefore, and why art thou in the path?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he turned to the ash-grey Serpent, and grovelled low on the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he drank of that pool of the blood where the stones of the wild were drowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long he lapped as a dog; but when he arose again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, a flock of the mountain-eagles that drew to the feastful plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he turned and looked on Sigurd, as bright in the sun he stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stripling fair and slender, and wiped the Wrath of the blood.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Regin cried: "O Dwarf-kind, O many-shifting folk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O shapes of might and wonder, am I too freed from the yoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That binds my soul to my body a withered thing forlorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the short-lived fools of man-folk so fair and oft are born?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now swift in the air shall I be, and young in the concourse of kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If my heart shall come to desire the gain of earthly things."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And he looked and saw how Sigurd was sheathing the Flame of War,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the eagles screamed in the wind, but their voice came faint from afar:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he scowled, and crouched and darkened, and came to Sigurd and spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O child, thou hast slain my brother, and the Wrath is alive and awake."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thou sayest sooth," said Sigurd, "thy deed and mine is done:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now our ways shall sunder, for here, meseemeth, the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath but little of deeds to do, and no love to win aback."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Regin crouched before him, and he spake: "Fare on to the wrack!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fare on to the murder of men, and the deeds of thy kindred of old!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And surely of thee as of them shall the tale be speedily told.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast slain thy Master's brother, and what wouldst thou say thereto,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were the judges met for the judging and the doom-ring hallowed due?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd spake as aforetime: "Thy deed and mine it was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now our ways shall sunder, and into the world will I pass."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Regin darkened before him, and exceeding grim was he grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he spake: "Thou hast slain my brother, and wherewith wilt thou atone?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Stand up, O Master," said Sigurd, "O Singer of ancient days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take the wealth I have won thee, ere we wend on the sundering ways.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have toiled and thou hast desired, and the Treasure is surely anear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou hast wisdom to find it, and I have slain thy fear."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Regin crouched and darkened: "Thou hast slain my brother," he said.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Take thou the Gold," quoth Sigurd, "for the ransom of my head!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Regin crouched and darkened, and over the earth he hung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he said: "Thou hast slain my brother, and the Gods are yet but young."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bright Sigurd towered above him, and the Wrath cried out in the sheath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Regin writhed against it as the adder turns on death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he spake: "Thou hast slain my brother, and today shalt thou be my thrall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea a King shall be my cook-boy and this heath my cooking-hall."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he crept to the ash-grey coils where the life of his brother had lain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he drew a glaive from his side and smote the smitten and slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tore the heart from Fafnir, while the eagles cried o'erhead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sharp and shrill was their voice o'er the entrails of the dead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Regin spake to Sigurd: "Of this slaying wilt thou be free?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then gather thou fire together and roast the heart for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I may eat it and live, and be thy master and more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For therein was might and wisdom, and the grudged and hoarded lore:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Or else, depart on thy ways afraid from the Glittering Heath."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he fell abackward and slept, nor set his sword in the sheath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his hand was red on the hilts and blue were the edges bared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ash-grey was his visage waxen, and with open eyes he stared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the height of heaven above him, and a fearful thing he seemed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As his soul went wide in the world, and of rule and kingship he dreamed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Sigurd took the Heart, and wood on the waste he found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wood that grew and died, as it crept on the niggard ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grew and died again, and lay like whitened bones;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the ernes cried over his head, as he builded his hearth of stones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kindled the fire for cooking, and sat and sang o'er the roast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The song of his fathers of old, and the Wolflings' gathering host:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So there on the Glittering Heath rose up the little flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dry sticks crackled amidst it, and alow the eagles came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seven they were by tale, and they pitched all round about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cooking-fire of Sigurd, and sent their song-speech out:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nought he knoweth its wisdom, or the word that they would speak:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span><span class="i0">And hot grew the Heart of Fafnir and sang amid the reek.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd looketh on Regin, and he deemeth it overlong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he dighteth the dear-bought morsel, and the might for the Master of wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he reacheth his hand to the roast to see if the cooking be o'er;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the blood and the fat seethed from it and scalded his finger sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he set his hand to his mouth to quench the fleshly smart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he tasted the flesh of the Serpent and the blood of Fafnir's Heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then there came a change upon him, for the speech of fowl he knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wise in the ways of the beast-kind as the Dwarfs of old he grew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he knitted his brows and hearkened, and wrath in his heart arose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he felt beset of evil in a world of many foes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the hilts of the Wrath he handled, and Regin's heart he saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how that the Foe of the Gods the net of death would draw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his bright eyes flashed and sparkled, and his mouth grew set and stern<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he hearkened the voice of the eagles, and their song began to learn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For the first cried out in the desert: "O mighty Sigmund's son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How long wilt thou sit and tarry now the dear-bought roast is done?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the second: "Volsung, arise! for the horns blow up to the hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dight are the purple hangings, and the King to the feasting should fall."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the third: "How great is the feast if the eater eat aright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Heart of the wisdom of old and the after-world's delight!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the fourth: "Yea, what of Regin? shall he scatter wrack o'er the world?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall the father be slain by the son, and the brother 'gainst brother be hurled?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the fifth: "He hath taught a stripling the gifts of a God to give:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hath reared up a King for the slaying, that he alone might live."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the sixth: "He shall waken mighty as a God that scorneth at truth;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span><span class="i0">He hath drunk of the blood of the Serpent, and drowned all hope and ruth."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the seventh: "Arise, O Sigurd, lest the hour be overlate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the sun in the mid-noon shineth, and swift is the hand of Fate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arise! lest the world run backward and the blind heart have its will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once again be tangled the sundered good and ill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest love and hatred perish, lest the world forget its tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Gods sit deedless, dreaming, in the high-walled heavenly vale."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then swift ariseth Sigurd, and the Wrath in his hand is bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he looketh, and Regin sleepeth, and his eyes wide-open glare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his lips smile false in his dreaming, and his hand is on the sword;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he dreams himself the Master and the new world's fashioning-lord.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his dream hath forgotten Sigurd, and the King's life lies in the pit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is nought; Death gnaweth upon him, while the Dwarfs in mastery sit.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But lo, how the eyes of Sigurd the heart of the guileful behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And great is Allfather Odin, and upriseth the Curse of the Gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Branstock bloometh to heaven from the ancient wondrous root;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The summer hath shone on its blossoms, and Sigurd's Wrath is the fruit:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dread then he cried in the desert: "Guile-master, lo thy deed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou nurst my life for destruction, and my death to serve thy need?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou kept me here for the net and the death that tame things die?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou feared me overmuch, thou Foe of the Gods on high?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest the sword thine hand was wielding should turn about and cleave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tangled web of nothing thou hadst wearied thyself to weave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo here the sword and the stroke! judge the Norns betwixt us twain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for me, I will live and die not, nor shall all my hope be vain."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then his second stroke struck Sigurd, for the Wrath flashed thin and white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'twixt head and trunk of Regin fierce ran the fateful light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there lay brother by brother a faded thing and wan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sigurd cried in the desert: "So far have I wended on!<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span><span class="i0">Dead are the foes of God-home that would blend the good and the ill;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now Sigurd eats of the heart that once in the Dwarf-king lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hoard of the wisdom begrudged, the might of the earlier day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then wise of heart was he waxen, but longing in him grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sow the seed he had gotten, and till the field he knew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he leapeth aback of Greyfell, and rideth the desert bare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hollow slot of Fafnir, that led to the Serpent's lair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then long he rode adown it, and the ernes flew overhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tidings great and glorious, of that Treasure of old they said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So far o'er the waste he wended, and when the night was come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the earth-old dwelling, the dread Gold-wallower's home:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the skirts of the Heath it was builded by a tumbled stony bent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High went that house to the heavens, down 'neath the earth it went.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of unwrought iron fashioned for the heart of a greedy king:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas a mountain, blind without, and within was its plenishing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the Hoard of Andvari the ancient, and the sleeping Curse unseen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Gold of the Gods that spared not and the greedy that have been.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Through the door strode Sigurd the Volsung, and the grey moon and the sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell in on the tawny gold-heaps of the ancient hapless Hoard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold gear of hosts unburied, and the coin of cities dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great spoil of the ages of battle, lay there on the Serpent's bed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge blocks from mid-earth quarried, where none but the Dwarfs have mined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wide sands of the golden rivers no foot of man may find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay 'neath the spoils of the mighty and the ruddy rings of yore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But amidst was the Helm of Aweing that the Fear of earth-folk bore,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span><span class="i0">And there gleamed a wonder beside it, the Hauberk all of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose like is not in the heavens nor has earth of its fellow told:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There Sigurd seeth moreover Andvari's Ring of Gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hope of Loki's finger, the Ransom's utmost grain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it shone on the midmost gold-heap like the first star set in the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the yellow space of even when moon-rise draweth anigh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then laughed the Son of Sigmund, and stooped to the golden land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gathered that first of the harvest and set it on his hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he did on the Helm of Aweing, and the Hauberk all of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose like is not in the heavens nor has earth of its fellow told:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he praised the day of the Volsungs amid the yellow light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he set his hand to the labour and put forth his kingly might;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dragged forth gold to the moon, on the desert's face he laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The innermost earth's adornment, and rings for the nameless made;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He toiled and loaded Greyfell, and the cloudy war-steed shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gear of Sigurd rattled in the flood of moonlight wan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There he toiled and loaded Greyfell, and the Volsung's armour rang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mid the yellow bed of the Serpent: but without the eagles sang:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bind the red rings, O Sigurd! let the gold shine free and clear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what hath the Son of the Volsungs the ancient Curse to fear?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bind the red rings, O Sigurd! for thy tale is well begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the world shall be good and gladdened by the Gold lit up by the sun."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bind the red rings, O Sigurd! and gladden all thine heart!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the world shall make thee merry ere thou and she depart."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bind the red rings, O Sigurd! for the ways go green below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go green to the dwelling of Kings, and the halls that the Queen-folk know."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bind the red rings, O Sigurd! for what is there bides by the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save the joy of folk to awaken, and the dawn of the merry day?"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bind the red rings, O Sigurd! for the strife awaits thine hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a plenteous war-field's reaping, and the praise of many a land."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bind the red rings, O Sigurd! But how shall storehouse hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That glory of thy winning and the tidings to be told?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the moon was dead, and the star-worlds were great on the heavenly plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the steed was fully laden; then Sigurd taketh the rein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turns to the ruined rock-wall that the lair was built beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there he deemed was the gate and the door of the Glittering Heath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not a whit moved Greyfell for aught that the King might do;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd pondered a while, till the heart of the beast he knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clad in all his war-gear he leaped to the saddle-stead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with pride and mirth neighed Greyfell and tossed aloft his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sprang unspurred o'er the waste, and light and swift he went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breasted the broken rampart, the stony tumbled bent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over the brow he clomb, and there beyond was the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A place of many mountains and great crags together hurled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So down to the west he wendeth, and goeth swift and light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the stars are beginning to wane, and the day is mingled with night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For full fain was the sun to arise and look on the Gold set free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Dwarf-wrought rings of the Treasure and the gifts from the floor of the sea.<br /></span>
</div></div>


<h4>How Sigurd awoke Brynhild upon Hindfell.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By long roads rideth Sigurd amidst that world of stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And somewhat south he turneth; for he would not be alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But longs for the dwellings of man-folk, and the kingly people's speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the days of the glee and the joyance, where men laugh each to each.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still the desert endureth, and afar must Greyfell fare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the wrack of the Glittering Heath, and Fafnir's golden lair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long Sigurd rideth the waste, when, lo, on a morning of day<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span><span class="i0">From out of the tangled crag-walls, amidst the cloud-land grey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes up a mighty mountain, and it is as though there burns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A torch amidst of its cloud-wreath; so thither Sigurd turns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he deems indeed from its topmost to look on the best of the earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Greyfell neigheth beneath him, and his heart is full of mirth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he rideth higher and higher, and the light grows great and strange,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forth from the clouds it flickers, till at noon they gather and change,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And settle thick on the mountain, and hide its head from sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the winds in a while are awakened, and day bettereth ere the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, lifted a measureless mass o'er the desert crag-walls high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cloudless the mountain riseth against the sunset sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea of the sun grown golden, as it ebbs from the day's desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the light that afar was a torch is grown a river of fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the mountain is black above it, and below is it dark and dun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there is the head of Hindfell as an island in the sun.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Night falls, but yet rides Sigurd, and hath no thought of rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he longs to climb that rock-world and behold the earth at its best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now mid the maze of the foot-hills he seeth the light no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the stars are lovely and gleaming on the lightless heavenly floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So up and up he wendeth till the night is wearing thin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he rideth a rift of the mountain, and all is dark therein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the stars are dimmed by dawning and the wakening world is cold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then afar in the upper rock-wall a breach doth he behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a flood of light poured inward the doubtful dawning blinds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So swift he rideth thither and the mouth of the breach he finds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sitteth awhile on Greyfell on the marvellous thing to gaze:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For lo, the side of Hindfell enwrapped by the fervent blaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nought 'twixt earth and heaven save a world of flickering flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a hurrying shifting tangle, where the dark rents went and came.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Great groweth the heart of Sigurd with uttermost desire,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span><span class="i0">And he crieth kind to Greyfell, and they hasten up, and nigher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he draweth rein in the dawning on the face of Hindfell's steep:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But who shall heed the dawning where the tongues of that wildfire leap?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they weave a wavering wall, that driveth over the heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind that is born within it; nor ever aside is it driven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the mightiest wind of the waste, and the rain-flood amidst it is nought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no wayfarer's door and no window the hand of its builder hath wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thereon is the Volsung smiling as its breath uplifteth his hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his eyes shine bright with its image, and his mail gleams white and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his war-helm pictures the heavens and the waning stars behind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his neck is Greyfell stretching to snuff at the flame-wall blind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his cloudy flank upheaveth, and tinkleth the knitted mail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gold of the uttermost waters is waxen wan and pale.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Sigurd turns in his saddle, and the hilt of the Wrath he shifts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And draws a girth the tighter; then the gathered reins he lifts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crieth aloud to Greyfell, and rides at the wildfire's heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the white wall wavers before him and the flame-flood rusheth apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And high o'er his head it riseth, and wide and wild is its roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it beareth the mighty tidings to the very heavenly floor:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he rideth through its roaring as the warrior rides the rye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When it bows with the wind of the summer and the hid spears draw anigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The white flame licks his raiment and sweeps through Greyfell's mane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bathes both hands of Sigurd and the hilts of Fafnir's bane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And winds about his war-helm and mingles with his hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nought his raiment dusketh or dims his glittering gear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then it fails and fades and darkens till all seems left behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dawn and the blaze is swallowed in mid-mirk stark and blind.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But forth a little further and a little further on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all is calm about him, and he sees the scorched earth wan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath a glimmering twilight, and he turns his conquering eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a ring of pale slaked ashes on the side of Hindfell lies;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span><span class="i0">And the world of the waste is beyond it; and all is hushed and grey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the new-risen moon is a-paleing, and the stars grow faint with day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd looked before him and a Shield-burg there he saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wall of the tiles of Odin wrought clear without a flaw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gold by the silver gleaming, and the ruddy by the white;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the blazonings of their glory were done upon them bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of dear things wrought for the war-lords new come to Odin's hall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Piled high aloft to the heavens uprose that battle-wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And far o'er the topmost shield-rim for a banner of fame there hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glorious golden buckler; and against the staff it rang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the earliest wind of dawning uprose on Hindfell's face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the light from the yellowing east beamed soft on the shielded place.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the Wrath cried out in answer as Sigurd leapt adown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the wasted soil of the desert by that rampart of renown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He looked but little beneath it, and the dwelling of God it seemed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As against its gleaming silence the eager Sigurd gleamed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He draweth not sword from scabbard, as the wall he wendeth around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it is but the wind and Sigurd that wakeneth any sound:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, lo, to the gate he cometh, and the doors are open wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no warder the way withstandeth, and no earls by the threshold abide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he stands awhile and marvels; then the baleful light of the Wrath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleams bare in his ready hand as he wendeth the inward path:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he doubteth some guile of the Gods, or perchance some Dwarf-king's snare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or a mock of the Giant people that shall fade in the morning air:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he getteth him in and gazeth; and a wall doth he behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the ruddy set by the white, and the silver by the gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But within the garth that it girdeth no work of man is set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the utmost head of Hindfell ariseth higher yet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And below in the very midmost is a Giant-fashioned mound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Piled high as the rims of the Shield-burg above the level ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there, on that mound of the Giants, o'er the wilderness forlorn,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span><span class="i0">A pale grey image lieth, and gleameth in the morn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So there was Sigurd alone; and he went from the shielded door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And aloft in the desert of wonder the Light of the Branstock he bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he set his face to the earth-mound, and beheld the image wan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dawn was growing about it; and, lo, the shape of a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set forth to the eyeless desert on the tower-top of the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High over the cloud-wrought castle whence the windy bolts are hurled.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now he comes to the mound and climbs it, and will see if the man be dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some King of the days forgotten laid there with crown&egrave;d head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the frame of a God, it may be, that in heaven hath changed his life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or some glorious heart belov&egrave;d, God-rapt from the earthly strife:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now over the body he standeth, and seeth it shapen fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clad from head to foot-sole in pale grey-glittering gear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a hauberk wrought as straitly as though to the flesh it were grown:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a great helm hideth the head and is girt with a glittering crown.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So thereby he stoopeth and kneeleth, for he deems it were good indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the breath of life abide there and the speech to help at need;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as sweet as the summer wind from a garden under the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cometh forth on the topmost Hindfell the breath of that sleeping-one.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he saith he will look on the face, if it bear him love or hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the bonds for his life's constraining, or the sundering doom of fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he draweth the helm from the head, and, lo, the brow snow-white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the smooth unfurrowed cheeks, and the wise lips breathing light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the face of a woman it is, and the fairest that ever was born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shown forth to the empty heavens and the desert world forlorn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he looketh, and loveth her sore, and he longeth her spirit to move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And awaken her heart to the world, that she may behold him and love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he toucheth her breast and her hands, and he loveth her passing sore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he saith; "Awake! I am Sigurd," but she moveth never the more.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he looked on his bare bright blade, and he said: "Thou&mdash;what wilt thou do?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For indeed as I came by the war-garth thy voice of desire I knew."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright burnt the pale blue edges for the sunrise drew anear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rims of the Shield-burg glittered, and the east was exceeding clear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the eager edges he setteth to the Dwarf-wrought battle-coat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the hammered ring-knit collar constraineth the woman's throat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the sharp Wrath biteth and rendeth, and before it fail the rings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, lo, the gleam of the linen, and the light of golden things:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he driveth the blue steel onward, and through the skirt, and out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till nought but the rippling linen is wrapping her about;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he deems her breath comes quicker and her breast begins to heave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he turns about the War-Flame and rends down either sleeve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till her arms lie white in her raiment, and a river of sun-bright hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flows free o'er bosom and shoulder and floods the desert bare.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then a flush cometh over her visage and a sigh up-heaveth her breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her eyelids quiver and open, and she wakeneth into rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wide-eyed on the dawning she gazeth, too glad to change or smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And but little moveth her body, nor speaketh she yet for a while;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet kneels Sigurd moveless her wakening speech to heed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While soft the waves of the daylight o'er the starless heavens speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gleaming rims of the Shield-burg yet bright and brighter grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the thin moon hangeth her horns dead-white in the golden glow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she turned and gazed on Sigurd, and her eyes met the Volsung's eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mighty and measureless now did the tide of his love arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For their longing had met and mingled, and he knew of her heart that she loved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she spake unto nothing but him and her lips with the speech-flood moved:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O, what is the thing so mighty that my weary sleep hath torn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rent the fallow bondage, and the wan woe over-worn?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He said: "The hand of Sigurd and the Sword of Sigmund's son,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span><span class="i0">And the heart that the Volsungs fashioned this deed for thee have done."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But she said: "Where then is Odin that laid me here alow?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long lasteth the grief of the world, and manfolk's tangled woe!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He dwelleth above," said Sigurd, "but I on the earth abide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I came from the Glittering Heath the waves of thy fire to ride."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But therewith the sun rose upward and lightened all the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the light flashed up to the heavens from the rims of the glorious girth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they twain arose together, and with both her palms outspread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bathed in the light returning, she cried aloud and said:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"All hail, O Day and thy Sons, and thy kin of the coloured things!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hail, following Night, and thy Daughter that leadeth thy wavering wings!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look down with unangry eyes on us today alive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give us the hearts victorious, and the gain for which we strive!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All hail, ye Lords of God-home, and ye Queens of the House of Gold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hail, thou dear Earth that bearest, and thou Wealth of field and fold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give us, your noble children, the glory of wisdom and speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hearts and the hands of healing, and the mouths and hands that teach!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then they turned and were knit together; and oft and o'er again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They craved, and kissed rejoicing, and their hearts were full and fain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd looketh upon her, and the words from his heart arise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou art the fairest of earth, and the wisest of the wise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O who art thou that lovest? I am Sigurd, e'en as I told;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have slain the Foe of the Gods, and gotten the Ancient Gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And great were the gain of thy love, and the gift of mine earthly days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If we twain should never sunder as we wend on the changing ways.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O who art thou that lovest, thou fairest of all things born?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what meaneth thy sleep and thy slumber in the wilderness forlorn?"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She said: "I am she that loveth: I was born of the earthly folk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of old Allfather took me from the Kings and their wedding yoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he called me the Victory-Wafter, and I went and came as he would,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I chose the slain for his war-host, and the days were glorious and good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the thoughts of my heart overcame me, and the pride of my wisdom and speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I scorned the earth-folk's Framer and the Lord of the world I must teach:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the death-doomed I caught from the sword, and the fated life I slew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I deemed that my deeds were goodly, and that long I should do and undo.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Allfather came against me and the God in his wrath arose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he cried: 'Thou hast thought in thy folly that the Gods have friends and foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they wake, and the world wends onward, that they sleep, and the world slips back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they laugh, and the world's weal waxeth, that they frown and fashion the wrack:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast cast up the curse against me; it shall fall aback on thine head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go back to the sons of repentance, with the children of sorrow wed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the Gods are great unholpen, and their grief is seldom seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wrong that they will and must be is soon as it had not been.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yet I thought: 'Shall I wed in the world, shall I gather grief on the earth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the fearless heart shall I wed, and bring the best to birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fashion such tales for the telling, that Earth shall be holpen at least,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the Gods think scorn of its fairness, as they sit at the changeless feast.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then somewhat smiled Allfather; and he spake: 'So let it be!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The doom thereof abideth; the doom of me and thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet long shall the time pass over ere thy waking-day be born:<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And now of the Niblung people the tale beginneth to tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How they deal with the wind and the weather; in the cloudy drift they dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the war is awake in the mountains, and they drive the desert spoil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their weaponed hosts unwearied through the misty hollows toil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But again in the eager sunshine they scour across the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spear by spear is quivering, and rein is laid by rein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dust is about and behind them, and the fear speeds on before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they shake the flowery meadows with the fleeting flood of war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, when they come from the battle, and the land lies down in peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No less in gear of warriors they gather earth's increase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And helmed as the Gods of battle they drive the team afield:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These come to the council of elders with sword and spear and shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shout to their war-dukes' dooming of their uttermost desire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These never bow the helm-crest before the High-Gods' fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But show their swords to Odin, and cry on Vingi-Thor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the dancing of the ring-mail and the smitten shields of war:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet though amid their high-tides of the deaths of men they sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of swords in the battle broken, and the fall of many a king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet they sing it wreathed with the flowers and they praise the gift and the gain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the war-lord sped to Odin as he rends the battle atwain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their days are young and glorious, and in hope exceeding great<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span><span class="i0">With sword and harp and beaker on the skirts of the Norns they wait.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the King of this folk is Giuki, and he sits in the Niblung hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the song of men goes roofward and the shields shine out from the wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his queen in the high-seat sitteth, the woman overwise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grimhild the kin of the God-folk, the wife of the glittering eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his sons on each hand are sitting; there is Gunnar the great and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the lovely face of a king 'twixt the night of his wavy hair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there is the wise-heart Hogni; and his lips are close and thin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grey and awful his eyen, and a many sights they win:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there is Guttorm the youngest, of the fierce and wandering glance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the heart that never resteth till the swords in the war-wind dance:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there is Gudrun his daughter, and light she stands by the board,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair are her arms in the hall as the beaker's flood is poured:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She comes, and the earls keep silence; she smiles, and men rejoice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She speaks, and the harps unsmitten thrill faint to her queenly voice.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So blossom the days of the Niblungs, and great is their hope's increase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt the merry days of battle and the tide of their guarded peace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is many a noon of joyance, and many an eve's delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a deed for the doing 'twixt the morning and the night.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now betimes on a morning of summer that Giuki's daughter arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone went the fair-armed Gudrun to her flowery garden-close;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And her nurse went down to meet her as she came by the rose-hung fence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she saw that her eyes were heavy as she trod with doubtful feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the rose and the lily, nor blessed the blossoms sweet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i6">"What ails thee, daughter, as one asleep to tread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the grass of the merry summer and the daisies white and red?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to have no heart for the harp-play, or the needle's mastery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the gold and the silk are framing the Swans of the Goths on the sea,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span><span class="i0">And helms and shields of warriors, and Kings on the hazelled isle?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why hast thou no more joyance on the damsels' glee to smile?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why biddest thou not to the wild-wood with horse and hawk and hound?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why biddest thou not to the heathland and the eagle-haunted ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet thy noble brethren as they ride from the mountain-road?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou deemed the hall of the Niblungs a churlish poor abode?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wouldst thou wend away from thy kindred, and scorn thy fosterer's praise?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Or is this the beginning of love and the first of the troublous days?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then spake the fair-armed Gudrun: "Nay, nought I know of scorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the noble kin of the Niblungs, or the house where I was born;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No pain of love hath smit me, and no evil days begin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I shall be fain tomorrow of the deeds that the maidens win:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if I wend the summer in dull unlovely seeming,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It comes of the night, O mother, and the tide of last night's dreaming."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then spake the ancient woman: "Thy dream to me shalt thou show;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such oft foretell but the weather, and the airts whence the wind shall blow."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Blood-red was waxen Gudrun, and she said: "But little it is:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meseems I sat by the door of the hall of the Niblungs' bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from out of the north came a falcon, and a marvellous bird it was;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his feathers were all of gold, and his eyes as the sunlit glass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hither and thither he flew about the kingdoms of Kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fear of men went with him, and the war-blast under his wings:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I feared him never a deal, nay, hope came into my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And meseemed in his war-bold ways I also had a part;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my eyes still followed his wings as hither and thither he swept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the doors and the dwellings of King-folk; till the heart within me leapt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For over the hall of the Niblungs he hung a little space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then stooped to my very knees, and cried out kind in my face:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fain and full was my heart, and I took him to my breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair methought was the world and a home of infinite rest."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span><span class="i0">Her speech dropped dead as she spake, and her eyes from the nurse she turned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now and again thereafter the flush in her fair cheek burned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her eyes were dreamy and great, as of one who looketh afar.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the nurse laughed out and answered: "Such the dreams of maidens are;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if thou hast told me all 'tis a goodly dream, forsooth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what should I call this falcon save a glorious kingly youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who shall fly full wide o'er the world in fame and victory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he hangs o'er the Niblung dwelling and stoops to thy very knee?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fain and full shall thine heart be, when his cheek shall cherish thy breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair things shalt thou deem of the world as a place of infinite rest."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But cold grew the maiden's visage: "God wot thou hast plenteous lore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the reading of dreams, my mother; but thou lovest thy fosterling sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the good and the evil alike shall turn in thine heart to good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wise too is my mother Grimhild, but I fear her guileful mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest she love me overmuch, and fashion all dreams to ill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now who is the wise of woman, who herein hath measureless skill?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For her forthright would I find, how far soever I fare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest I wend like a fool in the world, and rejoice with my feet in the snare."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Quoth the nurse: "Though the dream be goodly and its reading easy and light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is nought but a little matter if thy golden wain be dight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou ride to the land of Lymdale, the little land and green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And come to the hall of Brynhild, the maid and the shielded Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Queen and the wise of women, who sees all haps to come:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'twill be but light to bid her to seek thy dream-tale home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though surely shall she arede it in e'en such wise as I;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so shall the day be merry and the summer cloud go by."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thou hast spoken well," said Gudrun, "let us tarry now no whit;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So they make the yoke-beasts ready, and dight the wains for the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the maidens gather together, and their bodies they array,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gird the laps of the linen, and do on the dark-blue gear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bind with the leaves of summer the wandering of their hair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they drive by dale and acre, o'er heath and holt they wend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they come to the land of the waters, and the lea by the woodland's end;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there is the burg of Brynhild, the white-walled house and long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the garth her fathers fashioned before the days of wrong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fare their feet on the earth by the threshold of the Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Brynhild's damsels abide them, for their goings had been seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the mint and the blossomed woodruff they strew before their feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their arms of welcome take them, and they kiss them soft and sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they go forth into the feast-hall, the many-pillared house;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most goodly were its hangings and its webs were glorious<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tales of ancient fathers, and the Swans of the Goths on the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weaponed Kings on the island, and great deeds yet to be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the host of Odin's Choosers, and the boughs of the fateful Oak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gush of Mimir's Fountain, and the Midworld-Serpent's yoke.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So therein the maidens enter, but Gudrun all out-goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As over the leaves of the garden shines the many-folded rose:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst and alone she standeth; in the hall her arms shine white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her hair falls down behind her like a cloak of the sweet-breathed night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she casts her cloak to the earth, and the wind of the flowery tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Runs over her rippling raiment and stirs the gold at her side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she stands and may scarce move forward, and a red flush lighteth her face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As her eyes seek out Queen Brynhild in the height of the golden place.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But lo, as a swan on the sea spreads out her wings to arise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the face of the darksome ocean when the isle before her lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Brynhild arose from her throne and the fashioned cloths of blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she saw the Maid of the Niblungs, and the face of Gudrun knew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she gathers the laps of the linen, and they meet in the hall, they twain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Though forsooth the hall of Brynhild is no weary way to find:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How fare the kin of the Niblungs? is thy mother happy and hale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the ancient of days, thy father, the King of all avail?"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And my father's heart is happy, and the Niblung glory grows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the land in peace is lying 'neath the lily and the rose:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But love and the mirth of summer have moved my heart to come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To look on thy measureless beauty, and seek thy glory home."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O be thou welcome!" said Brynhild; "it is good when queen-folk meet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come now, O goodly sister, and sit in my golden seat:<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they sat, they twain, in the high-seat; and the maidens bore them wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they handled Dwarf-wrought treasures with their fingers fair and fine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lovely they were together, and they marvelled each at each:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet oft was Gudrun silent, and she faltered in her speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they matched great Kings and their war-deeds, and told of times that were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their fathers' fathers' doings, and the deaths of war-lords dear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at last the twain sat silent, and spake no word at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the western sky waxed ruddy, for the sun drew near its fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the speech of the murmuring maidens, and the voice of the toil of folk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Died out in the hall of Brynhild as the garden-song awoke.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Brynhild took up the word, and her voice was soft as she said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"We have told of the best of King-folk, the living and the dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hast thou heard, my sister, how the world grows fair with the word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a King from the mountains coming, a great and marvellous lord,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span><span class="i0">Who hath slain the Foe of the Gods, and the King that was wise from of old;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the heart and the eyes triumphant, and the lips that win and teach?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then met the eyes of the women, and Brynhild's word died out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bright flushed Gudrun's visage, and her lips were moved with doubt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But again spake Brynhild the wise:<br /></span>
<span class="i14">"He is come of a marvellous kin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of men that never faltered, and goodly days shall he win:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea now to this land is he coming, and great shall be his fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is born of the Volsung King-folk, and Sigurd is his name."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then all the heart laughed in her, but the speech of her lips died out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And red and pale waxed Gudrun, and her lips were moved with doubt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till she spake as a Queen of the Earth:<br /></span>
<span class="i14">"Sister, the day grows late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And meseemeth the watch of the earl-folk looks oft from the Niblung gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the gleam of our golden wains and the dust-cloud thin and soft;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nought shall they now behold them till the moon-lamp blazeth aloft.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell, and have thanks for thy welcome and thy glory that I have seen,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That we thine heart may gladden as thou gladdenedst ours today."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And she rose and kissed her sweetly as one that wendeth away:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And leave the word unspoken that lieth on thine heart?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Gudrun faltered and spake: "Yea, hither I came in sooth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a dream for thine eyes of wisdom, and a prayer for thine heart of ruth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But young in the world am I waxen, and the scorn of folk I fear<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then spake the daughter of Giuki: "Lo, this was the dream I dreamed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For without by the door of the Niblungs I sat in the morn, as meseemed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I saw a falcon aloft, and a glorious bird he was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his feathers glowed as the gold, and his eyes as the sunlit glass:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hither and thither he flew about the kingdoms of Kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fear was borne before him, and death went under his wings:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I feared him not, but loved him, and mine eyes must follow his ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the joy came into my heart, and hope of the happy days:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then over the hall of the Niblungs he hung a little space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stooped to my very knees, and cried out kind in my face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fain and full was my heart, and I took him to my breast,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So speaketh the Maid of the Niblungs, and speech her lips doth fail,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Again spake the daughter of Giuki: "Not yet hast thou hearkened all:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For meseemed my breast was reddened, as oft by the purple and pall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my heart was heavy within it, and I laid my hand thereon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the purple of blood enwrapped me, and the falcon I loved was gone."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet pale was the visage of Brynhild, and she said: "Is it then so strange<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thou shalt wed a King and be merry, and then shall come the sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the edges of hate shall be whetted and shall slay thy love and thy lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dead on thy breast shall he fall: and where then is the measureless moan?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the first to the last shalt thou have him, and scarce shall he die alone.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"I woke, and I wept," said Gudrun, "for the dear thing I had loved:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I slept, and again as aforetime were the gates of the dream-hall moved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I went in the land of shadows; and lo I was crowned as a queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I sat in the summer-season amidst my garden green;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there came a hart from the forest, and in noble wise he went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bold he was to look on, and of fashion excellent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before all beasts of the wild-wood; and fair gleamed that glorious-one,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So he came unto me and I loved him, and his head lay kind on my knees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair methought the summer, and a time of utter peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then darkened all the heavens and dreary grew the tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And medreamed that a queen I knew not was sitting by my side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from out of the din and the darkness, a hand and an arm there came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a golden sleeve was upon it, and red rings of the Queen-folk's fame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hand was the hand of a woman: and there came a sword and a thrust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the blood of the lovely wood-deer went wide about the dust.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I cried aloud in my sorrow, and lo, in the wood I was,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thy dream is all areded; I may tell thee nothing more:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt live and love and lose, and mingle in murder and war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it strange, O child of the Niblungs, that thy glory and thy pain<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For the rest, thou mayst not be lonely in thy welfare or thy woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hearts with thine heart shall be tangled: but the queen and the hand thou shalt know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we twain are wise together; thou shalt know of the sword and the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt know of the wild-wolves' howling and thy right-hand wet with blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the day of the smith is ended, and the stithy's fire dies out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the work of the master of masters through the feast-hall goeth about."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They stand apart by the high-seat, and each on each they gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though they forgat the summer, and the tide of the passing days,<br /></span>

<h4>How the folk of Lymdale met Sigurd the Volsung in the woodland.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Full fair was the land of Lymdale, and great were the men thereof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Heimir the King of the people was held in marvellous love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his wife was the sister of Brynhild, and the Queen of Queens was she;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his sons were noble striplings, and his daughters sweet to see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all these lived on in joyance through the good days and the ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor would shun the war's awaking; but now that the war was still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They looked to the wethers' fleeces and what the ewes would yield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And led their bulls from the straw-stall, and drave their kine afield;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they dealt with mere and river and all waters of their land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cast the glittering angle, and drew the net to the strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And searched the rattling shallows, and many a rock-walled well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the silver-scaled sea-farers, and the crook-lipped bull-trout dwell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But most when their hearts were merry 'twas the joy of carle and quean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ride in the deeps of the oak-wood, and the thorny thicket green:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth go their hearts before them to the blast of the strenuous horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the level sun comes dancing down the oaks in the early morn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There they strain and strive for the quarry, when the wind hath fallen dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the odorous dusk of the pine-wood, and the noon is high o'erhead:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There oft with horns triumphant their rout by the lone tree turns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When over the bison's lea-land the last of sunset burns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or by night and cloud all eager with shaft on string they fare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the wind from the elk-mead setteth, or the wood-boar's tangled lair:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span><span class="i0">For the wood is their barn and their storehouse, and their bower and feasting-hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many an one of their warriors in the woodland war shall fall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So now in the sweet spring season, on a morn of the sunny tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abroad are the Lymdale people to the wood-deers' house to ride:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they wend towards the sun's uprising, and over the boughs he comes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the merry wind is with him, and stirs the woodland homes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But their horns to his face cast clamour, and their hooves shake down the glades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hearts of their hounds are eager, and oft they redden blades;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till at last in the noon they tarry in a daisied wood-lawn green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And good and gay is their raiment, and their spears are sharp and sheen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they crown themselves with the oak-leaves, and sit, both most and least,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there on the forest venison and the ancient wine they feast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they wattle the twigs of the thicket to bear their spoil away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the toughness of the beech-boughs with the woodbine overlay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the voice of their merry labour the hall of the oakwood rings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fair they are and joyous as the first God-fashioned Kings.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now they gather their steeds together, that ere the moon is born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The candles of King Heimir may shine on harp and horn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as they stand by the stirrup and hand on rein is laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All eyes are turned to beholding the eastward-lying glade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thereby comes something glorious, as though an earthly sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were lit by the orb departing, lest the day should be wholly done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo now, as they stand astonied, a wonder they behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a warrior cometh riding, and his gear is all of gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grey is the steed and mighty beneath that lord of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a treasure of gold he beareth, and the gems of the ocean's floor:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now they deem the war-steed wondrous and the treasure strange they deem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But so exceeding glorious doth the harnessed rider seem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That men's hearts are all exalted as he draweth nigh and nigher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there are they abiding in fear and great desire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they look on the might of his limbs, and his waving locks they see,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span><span class="i0">And his glad eyes clear as the heavens, and the wreath of the summer tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That girdeth the dread of his war-helm, and they wonder at his sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tinkling rings of his hauberk, and the rings of the ancient Hoard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they say: Are the Gods on the earth? did the world change yesternight?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are the sons of Odin coming, and the days of Baldur the bright?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But forth stood Heimir the ancient, and of Gods and men was he chief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all who have handled the harp; and he stood betwixt blossom and leaf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrust his spear in the earth and cast abroad his hands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Hail, thou that ridest hither from the North and the desert lands!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now thy face is turned to our hall-door and thereby must be thy way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, unless the time so presseth that thou ridest night and day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It were good that thou lie in my house, and hearken the clink of the horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether peace in thy hand thou bear us, or war on thy saddle be borne;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether wealth thou seek, or friends, or kin, or a maiden lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or hast heart for the building of cities nor wilt hold thee aback for the cost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If fame thou wilt have among King-folk, to the land of the Kings art thou come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or wouldst thou adown to the sea-flood, thou must pass by the garth of our home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea art thou a God from the heavens, who wilt deem me little of worth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And art come for the wrack of my realm and wilt cast King Heimir forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou knowest I fear thee nothing, and no worse shall thy welcome be:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or art thou a wolf of the hearth, none here shall meddle with thee:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet lo, as I look on thine eyen, and behold thy hope and thy mirth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meseems thou art better than these, some son of the Kings of the Earth."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then spake the treasure-bestrider,&mdash;for his horse e'en now had he reined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the King and the earls of the people where the boughs of the thicket waned:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Yea I am a son of the Kings; but my kin have passed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once were they called the Volsungs, and the sons of God were they:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I am young, but have learned me wisdom; I am lone, but deeds have I done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have slain the Foe of the Gods, and the Bed of the Worm have I won.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But meseems that the earth is lovely, and that each day springeth anew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beareth the blossom of hope, and the fruit of deeds to do.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span><span class="i0">And herein thou sayest the sooth, that I seek the fame of Kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with them would I do and undo and be heart of their warfarings:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for this o'er the Glittering Heath to the kingdoms of earth am I come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over the head of Hindfell, and I seek the earl-folk's home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is called the lea of Lymdale 'twixt the wood and the water-side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For men call it the gate of the world where the Kings of Men abide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the least of God-folk am I, nor the wolf of the Kings accursed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sigurd the son of Sigmund in the land of the Helper nursed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I thank thee, lord, for thy bidding, and tonight will I bide in thine hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fare on the morrow to Lymdale and the deeds thenceforward to fall."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd leapt from Greyfell, and men were marvelling there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the sound of his sweet-mouthed wisdom, and his body shapen fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Heimir laughed and answered: "Now soon shall the deeds befall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tonight shalt thou ride to Lymdale and tonight shalt thou bide in my hall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I am the ancient Heimir, and my cunning is of the harp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though erst have I dealt in the sword-play while the edge of war was sharp."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd joyed to behold him, for a god-like King he was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And amid the men of Lymdale did the Son of Sigmund pass;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their hearts are high uplifted, for across the air there came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A breath of his tale half-spoken and the tidings of his fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their eyes are all unsatiate of gazing on his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his like have they never looked on for goodliness and grace.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they bear him the wine of welcome, and then to the saddle they leap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And get them forth from the wood-ways to the lea-land of the sheep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bull-fed Lymdale meadows; and thereover Sigurd sees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long white walls of Heimir amidst the blossomed trees:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the slim moon rises in heaven, and the stars in the tree-tops shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the golden roof of Heimir looks down on the torch-lit wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the song of men goes roofward in praise of Sigmund's Son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a joy to the Lymdale people is his glory new-begun.<br /></span>

<h4>How Sigurd met Brynhild in Lymdale.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So there abideth Sigurd with the Lymdale forest-lords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mighty honour holden, and in love beyond all words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thence abroad through the people there goeth a rumour and breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the great Gold-wallower's slaying, and the tale of the Glittering Heath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a word of the ancient Treasure and Greyfell's gleaming Load;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hearts of men grew eager, and the coming deeds abode.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But warily dealeth Sigurd, and he wends in the woodland fray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one whose heart is ready and abides a better day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the woodland fray he fareth, and oft on a day doth ride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the mighty forest wild-bulls and the lonely wolves abide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as then no other warfare do the lords of Lymdale know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the axe-age and the sword-age seem dead a while ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the age of the cleaving of shields, and of brother by brother slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bitter days of the whoredom, and the hardened lust of gain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But man to man may hearken, and he that soweth reaps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hushed is the heart of Fenrir in the wolf-den of the deeps.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now is it the summer-season, and Sigurd rideth the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his hound runs light before him, and his hawk sits light on his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all alone on a morning he rides the flowery sward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the woodland dwellings and the house of Lymdale's lord;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he hearkens Greyfell's going as he wends adown the lea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his heart for love is craving, and the deeds he deems shall be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he hears the Wrath's sheath tinkling as he rides the daisies down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he thinks of his love laid safely in the arms of his renown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lo, as he rides the meadows, before him now he sees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A builded burg arising amid the leafy trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a white-walled house on its topmost with a golden roof-ridge done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thereon the clustering dove-kind in the brightness of the sun.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span><span class="i0">So Sigurd stayed to behold it, for the heart within him laughed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But e'en then, as the arrow speedeth from the mighty archer's draught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth fled the falcon unhooded from the hand of Sigurd the King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And up, and over the tree-boughs he shot with steady wing:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the Volsung followed his flight, for he looked to see him fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the fluttering folk of the doves, and he cried the backward call<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full oft and over again; but the falcon heeded it nought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor turned to his kingly wrist-perch, nor the folk of the pigeons sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But flew up to a high-built tower, and sat in the window a space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crying out like the fowl of Odin when the first of the morning they face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then passed through the open casement as an erne to his eyrie goes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Much marvelled the Son of Sigmund, and rode to the fruitful close:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he said: Here a great one dwelleth, though none have told me thereof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he shall give me my falcon, and his fellowship and love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he came to the gate of the garth, and forth to the hall-door rode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leapt adown from Greyfell, and entered that fair abode;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For full lovely was it fashioned, and great was the pillared hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair in its hangings were woven the deeds that Kings befall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the merry sun went through it and gleamed in gold and horn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But afield or a-fell are its carles, and none labour there that morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And void it is of the maidens, and they weave in the bower aloft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or they go in the outer gardens 'twixt the rose and the lily soft:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So saith Sigurd the Volsung, and a door in the corner he spies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With knots of gold fair-carven, and the graver's masteries:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he lifts the latch and it opens, and he comes to a marble stair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And aloft by the same he goeth through a tower wrought full fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he comes to a door at its topmost, and lo, a chamber of Kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his falcon there by the window with all unruffled wings.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But a woman sits on the high-seat with gold about her head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ruddy rings on her arms, and the grace of her girdle-stead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sunlit is her rippled linen, and the green leaves lie at her feet,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span><span class="i0">And e'en as a swan on the billow where the firth and the out-sea meet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the dark-blue cloths she sitteth, so fair and softly made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are her limbs by the linen hidden, and so white is she arrayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a web of gold is before her, and therein by her shuttle wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The early days of the Volsungs and the war by the sea's rim fought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the crowned queen over Sigmund, and the Helper's pillared hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the golden babe uplifted to the eyes of duke and thrall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there was the slender stripling by the knees of the Dwarf-folk's lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gift of the ancient Gripir, and the forging of the Sword;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there were the coils of Fafnir, and the hooded threat of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the King by the cooking-fire, and the fowl of the Glittering Heath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there was the headless King-smith and the golden halls of the Worm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the laden Greyfell faring through the land of perished storm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there was the head of Hindfell, and the flames to the sky-floor driven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there was the glittering shield-burg, and the fallow bondage riven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there was the wakening woman and the golden Volsung done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they twain o'er the earthly kingdoms in the lonely evening sun:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there were fells and forests, and towns and tossing seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Wrath and the golden Sigurd for ever blent with these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the midst of the battle triumphant, in the midst of the war-kings' fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the midst of the peace well-conquered, in the midst of the praising hall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There Sigurd stood and marvelled, for he saw his deeds that had been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his deeds of the days that should be, fair wrought in the golden sheen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he looked in the face of the woman, and Brynhild's eyes he knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still in the door he tarried, and so glad and fair he grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the Gods laughed out in the heavens to see the Volsung's seed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the breeze blew in from the summer and over Brynhild's weed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till his heart so swelled with the sweetness that the fair word stayed in his mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a marvel beloved he seemeth, as a ship new-come from the south:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still she longed and beheld him, nor foot nor hand she moved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she marvelled at her gladness, and her love so well beloved.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span><span class="i0">But at last through the sounds of summer the voice of Sigurd came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it seemed as a silver trumpet from the house of the fateful fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he spake: "Hail, lady and queen! hail, fairest of all the earth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it well with the hap of thy life-days, and thy kin and the house of thy birth?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She said: "My kin is joyous, and my house is blooming fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dead, both root and branches, is the tree of their travail and care."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He spake: "I have longed, I have wondered if thy heart were well at ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the hope of thy days had blossomed and born thee fair increase."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O have thou thanks," said Brynhild, "for thine heart that speaketh kind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, the hope of my days is accomplished, and no more there is to find."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And again she spake in a space: "The road hath been weary and long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But well hast thou ridden it, Sigurd, and the sons of God are strong."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He said: "I have sought, O Brynhild, and found the heart of thine home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no man hath asked or holpen, and all unbidden I come."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She said: "O welcome hither! for the heart of the King I knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thine hope that overcometh, and thy will that nought shall undo."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Unbidden I came," he answered, "yet it is but a little space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since I heard thy voice on the mountain, and thy kind lips cherished my face."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She rose from the dark-blue raiment, and trembling there she stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no word her lips had gotten that her heart might deem it good:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his heart went forth to meet her, yet nought he moved for a while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the God-kin's laughter brake blooming from a smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he cried: "It is good, O Brynhild, that we draw exceeding near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest Odin mock Kings' children that the doom of fate they fear."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then forth she stepped from the high-seat, and forth from the threshold he came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till both their bodies mingling seemed one glory and the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And far o'er all fulfilment did the souls within them long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As at breast and at lips of the faithful the earthly love strained strong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fresh from the deeps of the summer the breeze across them blew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nought of the earth's desire, or the lapse of time they knew.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then apart, but exceeding nigh, for a little while they stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Brynhild toucheth her lord, and taketh his hand in her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she leadeth him through the chamber, and sitteth down in her seat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And him she setteth beside her, and she saith:<br /></span>
<span class="i18">"It is right and meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou sit in this throne of my fathers, since thy gift today I have:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast given it altogether, nor aught from me wouldst save;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou knowest the tale of women, how oft it haps on a day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That of such gifts men repent them, and their lives are cast away."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He said: "I have cast it away as the tiller casteth the seed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the summer may better the spring-tide, and the autumn winter's need:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what were the fruit of our lives if apart they needs must pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men shall say hereafter: Woe worth the hope that was!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She said: "That day shall dawn the best of all earthly days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we sit, we twain, in the high-seat in the hall of the people's praise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else, what fruit of our life-days, what fruit of our death shall be?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What fruit, save men's remembrance of the grief of thee and me?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He said: "It is sharper to bear than the bitter sword in the breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O woe, to think of it now in the days of our gleaning of rest!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said Brynhild: "I bid thee remember the word that I have sworn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How the sun shall turn to blackness, and the last day be outworn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere I forget thee, Sigurd, and the kindness of thy face."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And they kissed and the day grew later and noon failed the golden place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sigurd said: "O Brynhild, remember how I swore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the sun should die in the heavens and day come back no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere I forget thy wisdom and thine heart of inmost love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo now, shall I unsay it, though the Gods be great above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though my life should last for ever, though I die tomorrow morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I win the realm of the world, though I sink to the thrall-folk's scorn?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She said: "Thou shalt never unsay it, and thy heart is mine indeed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt bear my love in thy bosom as thou helpest the earth-folk's need:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt wake to it dawning by dawning; thou shalt sleep and it shall not be strange:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is none shall thrust between us till our earthly lives shall change.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, my love shall fare as a banner in the hand of thy renown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the arms of thy fame accomplished shall it lie when we lay us adown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O deathless fame of Sigurd! O glory of my lord!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O birth of the happy Brynhild to the measureless reward!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they sat as the day grew dimmer, and they looked on days to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fair tale speeding onward, and the glories of their home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they saw their crowned children and the kindred of the kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deeds in the world arising and the day of better things;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the earthly exaltation, till their pomp of life should be passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soft on the bosom of God their love should be laid at the last.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But when words have a long while failed them, and the night is nigh at hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They arise in the golden glimmer, and apart and anigh they stand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Brynhild stooped to the Wrath, and touched the hilts of the sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere she wound her arms round Sigurd and cherished the lips of her lord:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sweet were the tears of Brynhild, and fast and fast they fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the love that Sigurd uttered, what speech of song may tell?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But he turned and departed from her, and her feet on the threshold abode<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span><span class="i0">As he went through the pillared feast-hall, and forth to the night he rode:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he turned toward the dwelling of Heimir and his love and his fame seemed one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all full-well accomplished, what deeds soe'er were done:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the love that endureth for ever, and the endless hope he bore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he faced the change of Heaven and the chance of worldly war.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And nought from the fear of warriors bide the neat-herds from the field;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet full is the hall of Heimir with eager earls of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the long-locked happy shepherds are gathered round the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the smith has left his stithy, and the wife has left her rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bright thrums hang unwinded by the maiden's weaving-stock:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there is the wife and the maiden, the elder and the boy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scarce shall you tell what moves them, much sorrow or great joy.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But lo, as they gather and hearken by the door of Heimir's hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wave of a mighty music on the souls of men doth fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they bow their heads and hush them, because for a dear guest's sake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is Heimir's hand in the harp-strings and the ancient song is awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the words of the Gods' own fellow, and the hope of days gone by;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span><span class="i0">Then deep is that song-speech laden with the deeds that draw anigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a hope accomplished, and many an unhoped change,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And things of all once spoken, now grown exceeding strange;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then keen as the battle-piercer the string&egrave;d speech arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hearts of men went with it, as of them that meet the foes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then soared the song triumphant as o'er the world well won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till sweet and soft it ended as a rose falls 'neath the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thereafter was there silence till the earls cast up the shout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the whole house clashed and glittered as the tramp of men bore out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And folk fell back before them; then forth the earl-folk pour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forth comes Heimir the Ancient and stands by his fathers' door:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then is the feast-hall empty and none therein abides:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For forth on the cloudy Greyfell the Son of Sigmund rides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Helm of Awe he beareth, and the Mail-coat all of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hath not its like in the heavens nor has earth of its fellow told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Wrath to his side is girded, though the peace-strings wind it round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet oft and again it singeth, and strange is its sheath&egrave;d sound:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But beneath the King in his war-gear and beneath the wondrous Sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are the red rings of the Treasure, and the gems of Andvari's Hoard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And light goes Greyfell beneath it, and oft and o'er again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He neighs out hope of battle, for the heart of the beast is fain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So there sitteth Sigurd the Volsung, and is dight to ride his ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the world lies fair before him and the field of the people's praise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he kisseth the ancient Heimir, and haileth the folk of the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he crieth kind and joyous as the reins lie loose in his hand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Farewell, O folk of Lymdale, and your joy of the summer-tide!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the acres whiten, meseemeth, and the harvest-field is wide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who knows of the toil that shall be, when the reaping-hook gleams grey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the knees of the strong are loosened in the afternoon of day?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who knows of the joy that shall be, when the reaper cometh again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his sheaves are crowned with the blossoms, and the song goes up from the wain?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the glad steed neighed beneath him as they fared from the King's abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And out past the dewy closes; but the shouts went up to the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though some for very sorrow forbore the farewell cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor was any man but heavy that the godlike guest should go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they craved for that glad heart guileless, and that face without a foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Greyfell fareth onward, and back to the dusky hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now goeth the ancient Heimir, and back to bower and stall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And back to hammer and shuttle go earl and carle and quean;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And piping in the noontide adown the hollows green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go the yellow-headed shepherds amidst the scattered sheep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all hearts a dear remembrance and a hope of Sigurd keep.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But forth by dale and lealand doth the Son of Sigmund wend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till far away lies Lymdale and the folk of the forest's end;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he rides a heath unpeopled and holds the westward way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till a long way off before him come up the mountains grey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grey, huge beyond all telling, and the host of the heap&egrave;d clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The black and the white together, on that rock-wall's coping crowds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whiles are rents athwart them, and the hot sun pierceth through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there glow the angry cloud-caves 'gainst the everlasting blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the changeless snow amidst it; but down from that cloudy head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scars of fires that have been show grim and dusky-red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lower yet are the hollows striped down by the scanty green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lingering flecks of the cloud-host are tangled there-between,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White, pillowy, lit by the sun, unchanged by the drift of the wind.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Long Sigurd looked and marvelled, and up-raised his heart and his mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he deemed that beyond that rock-wall bode his chang&egrave;d love and life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the further side of the battle, and the hope, and the shifting strife:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So up and down he rideth, till at even of the day<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span><span class="i0">A hill's brow he o'ertoppeth that had hid the mountains grey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge, blacker they showed than aforetime, white hung the cloud-flecks there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But red was the cloudy crown, for the sun was sinking fair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wide plain lay beneath him, and a river through it wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the lea and the acres, and the misty orchard ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But forth from the feet of the mountains a ridg&egrave;d hill there ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That upreared at its hithermost ending a builded burg of man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sigurd deemed in his heart as he looked on the burg from afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the high Gods scarce might win it, if thereon they fell with war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So many and great were the walls, so bore the towers on high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The threat of guarded battle, and the tale of victory.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then swift he hasteneth downward, lest day be wholly spent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere he come to the gate well warded, and the walls' beleaguerment;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his heart is eager to hearken what men-folk therein dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the name of that noble dwelling, and the tale that it hath to tell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he rides by the tilth of the acres, 'twixt the overhanging trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And but seldom now and again a glimpse of the burg he sees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he comes to the flood of the river, and looks up from the balks of the bridge;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then how was the plain grown little 'neath that mighty burg of the ridge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'erhung by the cloudy mountains and the ash of another day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereto the slopes clomb upward till the green died out in the grey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the grey in the awful cloud-land, where the red rents went and came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round the snows no summers minish and the far-off sunset flame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lo, the burg at the ridge-end! have the Gods been building again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since they watched the aimless Giants pile up the wall of the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The house for none to dwell in? Or in what days lived the lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who 'neath those thunder-forges upreared that battle's ward?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or was not the Smith at his work, and the blast of his forges awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the world's heart poured from the mountain for that ancient people's sake?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as waves on the iron river of the days whereof nothing is told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood up the many towers, so stark and sharp and cold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But dark-red and worn and ancient as the midmost mountain-sides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the wall that goeth about them; and its mighty compass hides<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span><span class="i0">Full many a dwelling of man whence the reek now goeth aloft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the voice of the house-abiders, the sharp sounds blent with the soft:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one house in the midst is unhidden and high up o'er the wall it goes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloft in the wind of the mountains its golden roof-ridge glows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down mid its buttressed feet is the wind's voice never still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the day and the night pass o'er it and it changes to their will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whiles is it glassy and dark, and whiles is it white and dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whiles is it grey as the sea-mead, and whiles is it angry red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it shimmers under the sunshine and grows black to the threat of the storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dusk its gold roof glimmers when the rain-clouds over it swarm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bright in the first of the morning its flame doth it uplift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the light clouds rend before it and along its furrows drift.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Upriseth the heart of Sigurd, but ever he rideth forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he comes to the garth and the gateway built up in the face of the north:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then e'en as a wind from the mountains he heareth the warders' speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As aloft in the mighty towers they clamour each to each:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then horn to horn blew token, and far and shrill they cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he heard, as the fishers hearken the cliff-fowl over the tide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he rode in under the gate, that was long and dark as a cave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bored out in the isles of the northland by the beat of the restless wave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the noise of the winds was within it, and the sound of swords unseen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the night when the host is stirring and the hearts of Kings are keen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no man stayed or hindered, and the dusk place knew his smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And into the court of the warriors he came forth after a while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looked aloft to the hall-roof, high up and grey as the cloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the sun was wholly perished; and there he crieth aloud:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ho, men of this mighty burg, to what folk of the world am I come?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the Burg of the Niblung people and the heart of their warfaring."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There were many men about him, and the wind in the wall-nook sang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the spears of the Niblungs glittered, and the swords in the forecourt rang.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they looked on his face in the even, and they hushed their voices and gazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fear and great desire the hearts of men amazed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now cometh an earl to King Giuki as he sits in godlike wise<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But the earl saith: "Lord of the people, choose now what thou wilt do;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For here is a strange new-comer, and he saith, to thee alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will he tell of his name and his kindred, and the deeds that his hand hath done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he beareth a Helm of Aweing and a Hauberk all of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hath not its like in the heavens nor has earth of its fellow told;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strange is all his raiment, and he beareth a Dwarf-wrought sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his war-steed beareth beneath him red rings of a mighty Hoard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the ancient gems of the sea-floor: there he sits on his cloud-grey steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his eyes are bright in the even, and we deem him mighty indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our hearts are upraised at his coming; but how shall I tell thee or say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he be a King of the Kings and a lord of the earthly day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or if rather the Gods be abroad and he be one of these?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But forsooth no battle he biddeth, nor craveth he our peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So choose herein, King Giuki, wilt thou bid the man begone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his house of the earth or the heavens, lest a worser deed be won,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That the Volsung lived in their house, that a King of the Kings they had.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then silent awhile the Maiden, the fair-armed Gudrun, stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet might all men see by her visage that she deemed his coming good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at last the gold she taketh, and before him doth she stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she poureth the wine of King-folk, and stretcheth forth her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she saith: "Hail, Sigurd the Volsung! may I see thy joy increase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy shielded sons beside thee, and thy days grown old in peace!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">And no hate and no repentance, and no fear to come they know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fared the feast of the Niblungs on the eve that Sigurd came<br /></span>

great fame and glory.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now gone is the summer season and the harvest of the year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And amid the winter weather the deeds of the Niblungs wear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nought is their joyance worsened, or their mirth-tide waxen less,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the swooping mountain tempest howl round their ridgy ness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though a house of the windy battle their streeted burg be grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the heaped-up, huddled cloud-drift be their very hall-roofs crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the rivers bear the burden, and the Rime-Gods grip and strive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the snow in the mirky midnoon across the lealand drive.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But lo, in the stark midwinter how the war is smitten awake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the blue-clad Niblung warriors the spears from the wall-nook take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gird the dusky hauberk, and the ruddy fur-coat don,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And draw the yellowing ermine o'er the steel from Welshland won.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they show their tokened war-shields to the moon-dog and the stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the hurrying wind of the mountains has borne them tale of wars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo now, in the court of the warriors they gather for the fray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the sun's uprising, in the moonless morn of day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the spears by the dusk gate glimmer, and the torches shine on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the murmuring voice of women comes faint from the cloudy hall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the grey dawn beats on the mountains mid a drift of frosty snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all men the face of Sigurd mid the swart-haired Niblungs know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they see his gold gear glittering mid the red fur and the white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And high are the hearts uplifted by the hope of happy fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they see the sheathed Wrath shimmer mid the restless Welsh-wrought swords,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span><span class="i0">And their hearts rejoice beforehand o'er the fall of conquered lords;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they see the Helm of Aweing and the awful eyes beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they deem the victory glorious, and fair the warrior's death.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So forth through that cave of the gate from the Niblung Burg they fare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they turn their backs on the plain, and the mountain-slopes they dare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the place of the slaked earth-forges, as the eastering wind shall lead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And but few swords bide behind them the Niblung Burg to heed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lo, in the jaws of the mountains how few and small they seem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As dusky-strange in the snow-drifts their knitted hauberks gleam:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, now at the mountains' outmost 'neath Sigurd's gleaming eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How wide in the winter season the citied lealand lies:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, how the beacons are flaring, and the bell-swayed steeples rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gates of cities are shaken with the back-swung door-leaves' shock:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, lo, the terror of towns, and the land that the winter wards,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over the streets snow-muffled the clash of the Niblung swords.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the slaves of the Kings are gathered, and their host the battle abides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forth in the front of the Niblungs the golden Sigurd rides;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Gunnar smites on his right hand, and Hogni smites on the left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glad is the heart of Guttorm, and the Southland host is cleft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the grey bill reapeth the willows in the autumn of the year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the fish lie still in the eddies, and the rain-flood draweth anear.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now sheathed is the Wrath of Sigurd; for as wax withstands the flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the Kings of the land withstood him and the glory of his fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And before the grass is growing, or the kine have fared from the stall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The song of the fair-speech-masters goes up in the Niblung hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they sing of the golden Sigurd and the face without a foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lowly man exalted and the mighty brought alow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they say, when the sun of summer shall come aback to the land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It shall shine on the fields of the tiller that fears no heavy hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the sheaf shall be for the plougher, and the loaf for him that sowed,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Full dear was Sigurd the Volsung to all men most and least,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, as the spring drew onward, 'twas deemed a goodly feast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the acre-biders' children by the Niblung Burg to wait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If perchance the Son of Sigmund should ride abroad by the gate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For whosoever feared him, no little-one, forsooth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would shrink from the shining eyes and the hand that clave out truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the heart of the wrack and the battle: it was then, as his gold gear burned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the balks of the bridge and the river, that oft the mother turned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spake to the laughing baby: "O little son, and dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I from the world am departed, and whiles a-nights ye hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The best of man-folk longing for the least of Sigurd's days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt hearken to their story, till they tell forth all his praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And become beloved and a wonder, as thou sayest when all is sung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'And I too once beheld him in the days when I was young.'"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Men say that the white-armed Gudrun, the lovely Giuki's child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked long on Sigurd's visage in the winter weather wild<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the eve of the Kings' departure; and she bore him wine and spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou goest to the war, O Sigurd, for the Niblung brethren's sake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so women send their kindred on many a doubtful tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dead full oft on the death-field shall the hope of their lives abide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor must they fear beforehand, nor weep when all is o'er;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou, our guest and our stranger, thou goest to the war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who knows but thine hand may carry the hope of all the earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now therefore if thou deemest that my prayer be aught of worth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wilt scorn the child of a Niblung that prays for things to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pledge me for thy glad returning, and the sheaves of fame borne home!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He laughed, for his heart was merry for the seed of battle sown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the fruit of love's fulfilment, and the blossom of renown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he said: "I look in the wine-cup and I see goodwill therein;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span><span class="i0">Be merry, Maid of the Niblungs; for these are the prayers that win!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He drank, and the soul within him to the love and the glory turned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all unmoved was her visage, howso her heart-strings yearned.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But again when the bolt of battle on the sleeping kings had been hurled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gold-tipped cloud of the Niblungs had been sped on the winter world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once more in that hall of the stories was dight triumphant feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in joy of soul past telling sat all men most and least,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There stood the daughter of Giuki by the king-folk's happy board,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grave and stern was Gudrun as the wine of kings she poured:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sigurd smiled upon her, and he said:<br /></span>
<span class="i18">"O maid, rejoice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thy pledge's fair redeeming, and the hope of thy kindly voice!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast prayed for the guest and the stranger, and, lo, from the battle and wrack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the hope of the Niblungs blossomed, and thy brethren's lives come back."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She turned and looked upon him, and the flush ran over her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And died out as the summer lightning, that scarce endureth a space;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still was her visage troubled, as she said: "Hast thou called me kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because I feared for earth's glory when point and edge are blind?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now is the night as the day, when thou bringest my brethren home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And back in the arms of thy glory the Niblung hope has come."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But his eyes look kind upon her, and the trouble passeth away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there in the hall of the Niblungs is dark night as glorious day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now spring o'er the winter prevaileth, and the blossoms brighten the field;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lo, in the flowery lealands the gleam of spear and shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For swift to the tidings of warfare speeds on the Niblung folk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Kings to the sea are riding, and the battle-laden oak.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the isle-abiders tremble, and the dwellers by the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the nesses flare with the beacons, and the shepherds leave the lea,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span><span class="i0">As the tale of the golden warrior speeds on from isle to isle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now spread is the snare of treason, and cast is the net of guile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the mirk-wood gleams with the ambush, and venom lurks at the board;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whiles and again for a little the fair fields gleam with the sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the host of the isle-folk gather, nigh numberless of tale:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But how shall its bulk and its writhing the willow-log avail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the red flame lives amidst it? Lo now, the golden man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the towns from of old time famous, by the temples tall and wan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How he wends with the swart-haired Niblungs through the mazes of the streets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hosts of the conquered outlands and their uncouth praying meets.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There he wonders at their life-days and their fond imaginings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he bears the love of Brynhild through the houses of the kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where his word shall do and undo, and with crowns of kings shall he deal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he laughs to scorn the treasure where thieves break through and steal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the moth and the rust are corrupting: and he thinks the time is long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the dawning of love's summer from the cloudy days of wrong.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they raise and abase and alter, then turn about and ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mid the peace of the sword triumphant, to the shell-strown ocean's side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they bear their glory away to the mouth of the fishy stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And again in the Niblung lealand doth the Welsh-wrought war-gear gleam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they come to the Burg of the Niblungs and the mighty gate of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And betwixt the gathered maidens through its dusky depths they pour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with war-helms done with blossoms round the Niblung hall they sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the windless cloudless even and the ending of the spring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, they sing the song of Sigurd and the face without a foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they sing of the prison's rending and the tyrant laid alow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the golden thieves' abasement, and the stilling of the churl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the mocking of the dastard where the chasing edges whirl;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they sing of the outland maidens that thronged round Sigurd's hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sung in the streets of the foemen of the war-delivered land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they tell how the ships of the merchants come free and go at their will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how wives in peace and safety may crop the vine-clad hill;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span><span class="i0">How the maiden sits in her bower, and the weaver sings at his loom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forget the kings of grasping and the greedy days of gloom;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For by sea and hill and township hath the Son of Sigmund been.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looked on the folk unheeded, and the lowly people seen.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then into the hall of the Niblungs go the battle-staying earls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they cast the spoil in the midmost; the webs of the out-sea pearls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gold-enwoven purple that on hated kings was bright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair jewelled swords accurs&egrave;d that never flashed in fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowns of old kings of battle that dastards dared to wear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great golden shields dishonoured, and the traitors' battle-gear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chains of the evil judges, and the false accusers' rings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cloud-wrought silken raiment of the cruel whores of kings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they cried: "O King of the people, O Giuki old of years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, the wealth that Sigurd brings thee from the fashioners of tears!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take thou the gift, O Niblung, that the Volsung seed hath brought!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we fought on the guarded fore-shore, in the guileful wood we fought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we fought in the traitorous city, and the murder-halls of kings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sigurd showed us the treasure, and won us the ruddy rings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the jaws of the treason and death, and redeemed our lives from the snare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the uttermost days might know it, and the day of the Niblungs be fair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all this he giveth to thee, as the Gods give harvest and gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sit in their thrones of the heavens of the praise of the people fain."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd passed through the hall, and fair was the light of his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he came to King Giuki the ancient, and Grimhild the overwise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stooped to the elder of days and kissed the war-wise head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they loved him passing sore as a very son of their bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he stood in the sight of the people, and sweet he was to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no foe and no betrayer, and no envier now hath he:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Gunnar the bright in the battle deems him his earthly friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hogni is fain of his fellow, howso the day's work end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Guttorm the young is joyous of the help and gifts he hath;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span><span class="i0">And all these would shine beside him in the glory of his path;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is none to hate or hinder, or mar the golden day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the light of love flows plenteous, as the sun-beams hide the way.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now there was the white-armed Gudrun, the lovely Giuki's child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her eyes beheld his glory, but her heart was unbeguiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dear hope fainted in her: I am frail and weak, she saith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he so great and glorious with the eyes that look on death!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet she comes, and speaks before him as she bears the golden horn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The world is glad, O Sigurd, that ever thou wert born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I with the world am rejoicing: drink now to the Niblung bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I, a deedless maiden, may thank thee well for this!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he drank of the cup at her bidding and laughed, and said, "Forsooth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good-will with the cup is blended, and the very heart of ruth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet meseems thy words are merrier than thine inmost soul this eve;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, cast away thy sorrow, lest the Kings of battle grieve!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She smiled and departed from him, and there in the cloudy hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the feast of their glad returning the Niblung children fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And far o'er the flowery lealand the shepherds of the plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold the litten windows, and know that Kings are fain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So fares the tale of Sigurd through all kingdoms of the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tale is told of his doings by the utmost ocean's girth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair feast the merchants deem it to warp their sea-beat ships<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High up the Niblung River, that their sons may hear his lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shed fair words o'er their ladings and the opened southland bales;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they get them aback to their countries, and tell how all men's tales<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are nought, and vain and empty in setting forth his grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the unmatched words of his wisdom, and the glory of his face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came the wise men too from the outlands, and the lords of singers' fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That men might know hereafter the deeds that knew his name;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span><span class="i0">And all these to their lands departed, and bore aback his love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cherished the tree of his glory, and lived glad in the joy thereof.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But men say that howsoever all other folk of earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loved Sigmund's son rejoicing, and were bettered of their mirth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet ever the white-armed Gudrun, the dark-haired Niblung Maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the barren heart of sorrow her love upon him laid:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rejoiceth, and she droopeth; he speaks and hushed is she;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He beholds the world's days coming, nought but Sigurd may she see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He is wise and her wisdom falters; he is kind, and harsh and strange<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes the voice from her bosom laden, and her woman's mercies change.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He longs, and she sees his longing, and her heart grows cold as a sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her heart is the ravening fire, and the fretting sorrows' hoard.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, shall she not wander away to the wilds and the wastes of the deer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or down to the measureless sea-flood, and the mountain marish drear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, still shall she bide and behold him in the ancient happy place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And speak soft as the other women with wise and queenly face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woe worth the while for her sorrow, and her hope of life forlorn!<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now again in the latter summer do those Kings of the Niblungs ride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To chase the sons of the plunder that curse the ocean-side:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So over the oaken rollers they run the cutters down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till fair in the first of the deep are the glittering bows up-thrown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, shining wet and steel-clad, men leap from the surfy shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hang their shields on the gunwale, and cast abroad the oar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then full to the outer ocean swing round the golden beaks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sigurd sits by the tiller and the host of the spoilers seeks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lo, by the rim of the out-sea where the masts of the Vikings sway,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span><span class="i0">And their bows plunge down to the sea-floor as they ride the ridgy way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And show the slant decks covered with swords from stem to stern:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hark now, how the horns of battle for the clash of warriors yearn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the mighty song of mocking goes up from the thousands of throats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As down the wind and landward the raven-banner floats:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they see thin streaks and shining o'er the waters' face draw nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And about each streak a foam-wake as the wet oars toss on high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they shout; for the silent Niblungs round those great sea-castles throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the eager men unshielded swarm up the heights of wrong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from bulwark unto bulwark the Wrath's flame sings and leaps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the unsteered manless dragons drift down the weltering deeps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the waves toss up a shield-foam, and hushed are the clamorous throats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dead in the summer even the raven-banner floats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Niblung song goes upward, as the sea-burgs long accursed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are swept toward the field-folk's houses, and the shores they saddened erst:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo there on the poop stands Sigurd mid the black-haired Niblung kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his heart goes forth before him toward the day of better things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the burg in the land of Lymdale, and the hands that bide him there.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But now with the spoil of the spoilers mid the Niblungs doth he fare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the Kings have dight the beacons and the warders of the coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fire may call to fire for the swift redeeming host.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they fare to the Burg of the people, and leave that lealand free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That a maid may wend untroubled by the edges of the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glad in the autumn season they sit them down again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the shrines of the Gods of the Niblungs, and the hallowed hearths of men.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So there on an eve is Sigurd in the ancient Niblung hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the cloudy hangings waver and the flickering shadows fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he sits by the Kings on the high-seat, and wise of men he seems,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of many a hidden marvel past thought of man he dreams:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the Head of Hindfell he thinketh, and how fair the woman was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how that his love hath blossomed, and the fruit shall come to pass;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span><span class="i0">And he thinks of the burg in Lymdale, and how hand met hand in love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor deems him aught too feeble the heart of the world to move;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more than a God he seemeth, and so steadfast and so great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the sea of chance wide-weltering 'neath his will must needs abate.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">High riseth the glee of the people, and the song and the clank of the cup<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beat back from pillar to pillar, to the cloud-blue roof go up;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men's hearts rejoice in the battle, and the hope of coming days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till scarce may they think of their fathers, and the kings of bygone praise.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Giuki looketh on Sigurd and saith from heart grown fain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To sit by the silent wise-one, how mighty is the gain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet we know this long while, Sigurd, that lovely is thy speech;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou tell us the tales of the ancient, and the words of masters teach?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the joy of our hearts is stormy with mighty battles won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet shall be their lulling with thy tale of deeds agone."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then they brought the harp to Sigurd, and he looked on the ancient man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As his hand sank into the strings, and a ripple over them ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he looked forth kind o'er the people, and all men on his glory gazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hearkened, hushed and happy, as the King his voice upraised;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There he sang of the works of Odin, and the hails of the heavenly coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sons of God uprising, and the Wolflings' gathering host;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he told of the birth of Rerir, and of Volsung yet unborn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the deeds of his father's father, and his battles overworn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he told of Signy and Sigmund, and the changing of their lives;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tales of great kings' departing, and their kindred and their wives.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his song and his fond desire go up to the cloudy roof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blend with the eagles' shrilling in the windy night aloof.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he made an end of his story, and he sat and longed full sore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the days of all his longing as a story might be o'er:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the wonder of the people, and their love of Sigurd grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And green grew the tree of the Volsungs, as the Branstock blossomed anew.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now up rose Grimhild the wise-wife, and she stood by Sigurd and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"There is none of the kings of kingdoms that may match thy goodlihead:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo now, thou hast sung of thy fathers; but men shall sing of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therewith shall our house be remembered, and great shall our glory be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I beseech thee hearken a little to a faithful word of mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou of this cup hast drunken; for my love is blent with the wine."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He laughed and took the cup: But therein with the blood of the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth's hidden might was mingled, and deeds of the cold sea's birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And things that the high Gods turn from, and a tangle of strange love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep guile, and strong compelling, that whoso drank thereof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should remember not his longing, should cast his love away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembering dead desire but as night remembereth day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So Sigurd looked on the horn, and he saw how fair it was scored<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the cunning of the Dwarf-kind and the masters of the sword;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he drank and smiled on Grimhild above the beaker's rim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she looked and laughed at his laughter; and the soul was changed in him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men gazed and their hearts sank in them, and they knew not why it was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why the fair-lit hall was darkling, nor what had come to pass:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they saw the sorrow of Sigurd, who had seen but his deeds erewhile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the face of the mighty darkened, who had known but the light of its smile.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Grimhild looked and was merry: and she deemed her life was great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her hand a wonder of wonders to withstand the deeds of Fate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she saw by the face of Sigurd and the token of his eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That her will had abased the valiant, and filled the faithful with lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blinded the God-born seer, and turned the steadfast athwart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smitten the pride of the joyous, and the hope of the eager heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hush of the hall she hearkened, and the fear of men she knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all this was a token unto her, and great pride within her grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she saw the days that were coming from the well-spring of her blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goodly and glorious and great by the kings of her kindred she stood,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span><span class="i0">And faced the sorrow of Sigurd, and her soul of that hour was fain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she thought: I will heal the smitten, I will raise up the smitten and slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take heed where the Gods were heedless, and build on where they began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And frame hope for the unborn children and the coming days of man.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she spake aloud to the Volsung: "Hear this faithful word of mine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the draught thou hast drunken, O Sigurd, and my love was blent with the wine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Sigurd, son of the mighty, thy kin are passed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But uplift thine heart and be merry, for new kin hast thou gotten today;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy father is Giuki the King, and Grimhild thy mother is made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy brethren are Gunnar and Hogni and Guttorm the unafraid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoice for a kingly kindred, and a hope undreamed before!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the folk shall be wax in the fire that withstandeth the Niblung war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waste shall bloom as a garden in the Niblung glory and trust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wrack of the Niblung people shall burn the world to dust:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our peace shall still the world, our joy shall replenish the earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of thee it cometh, O Sigurd, the gold and the garland of worth!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the heart was changed in Sigurd; as though it ne'er had been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His love of Brynhild perished as he gazed on the Niblung Queen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brynhild's belov&egrave;d body was e'en as a wasted hearth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more for bale or blessing, for plenty or for dearth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;O ye that shall look hereafter, when the day of Sigurd is done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the last of his deeds is accomplished, and his eyes are shut in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When ye look and long for Sigurd, and the image of Sigurd behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his white sword still as the moon, and his strong hand heavy and cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then perchance shall ye think of this even, then perchance shall ye wonder and cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Twice over, King, are we smitten, and twice have we seen thee die."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As folk of the summer feasters, who have fallen to feast in the morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And have wreathed their brows with roses ere the first of the clouds was born;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the boughs were they sitting, and the long leaves twinkled about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wind with their laughter was mingled, nor held aback from their shout,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span><span class="i0">Amidst of their harp it lingered, from the mouth of their horn went up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round the reek of their roast was it breathing, o'er the flickering face of their cup&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Lo now, why sit they so heavy, and why is their joy-speech dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why are the long leaves drooping, and the fair wind hushed overhead?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look out from the sunless boughs to the yellow-mirky east,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How the clouds are woven together o'er that afternoon of feast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are heavier clouds above them, and the sun is a hidden wonder,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It rains in the nether heaven, and the world is afraid with the thunder:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en so in the hall of the Niblungs, and the holy joyous place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat the earls on the marvel gazing, and the sorrow of Sigurd's face.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Men say that a little after the evil of that night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All waste is the burg of Brynhild, and there springeth a marvellous light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the desert hard by Lymdale, and few men know for why;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there are, who say that a wildfire thence roareth up to the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round a glorious golden dwelling, wherein there sitteth a Queen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In remembrance of the wakening, and the slumber that hath been;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein a Maid there sitteth, who knows not hope nor rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For remembrance of the Mighty, and the Best come forth from the Best.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the hushed Kings sat in the feast-hall, till Grimhild cried on the harp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the minstrels' fingers hastened, and the sound rang clear and sharp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the cloudy roof-tree, but no joyance with it went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no voice but the eagles' crying with the string&egrave;d song was blent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as it began, it ended, and no soul had been moved by its voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lament o'er the days passed over, or in coming days to rejoice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Late groweth the night o'er the people, but no word hath Sigurd said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since he laughed o'er the glittering Dwarf-gold and raised the cup to his head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No wrath in his eyes is arisen, no hope, nor wonder, nor fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet is Sigurd's face as boding to folk that behold him anear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the mountain that broodeth the fire o'er the town of man's delights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the sky that is cursed nor thunders, as the God that is smitten nor smites.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So silent sitteth the Volsung o'er the blindness of the wrong,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the morrow of tomorrow that the light may be fair to their eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their days as the days of the joyous: so now from the throne they arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their men depart from the feast-hall, their care in sleep to lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But none durst speak with Sigurd, nor ask him, whither away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he strideth dumb from amidst them; and all who see him deem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he heedeth the folk of the Niblungs but as people of a dream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they fall away from about him, till he stands in the forecourt alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he fares to the kingly stables, nor knoweth he his own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor backeth the cloudy Greyfell, but a steed of the Kings he bestrides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forth through the gate of the Niblungs and into the night he rides:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Yea he with no deed before him, and he in the raiment of peace;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In the deedless dark he rideth, and all things he remembers save one,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He hasteneth not nor stayeth; he lets the dark die out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere he comes to the burg of Brynhild and rides it round about;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he lets the sun rise upward ere he rideth thence away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wendeth he knoweth not whither, and he weareth down the day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till lo, a plain and a river, and a ridge at the mountains' feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a burg of people builded for the lords of God-home meet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the bridge of the river he rideth, and unto the burg-gate comes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In no lesser wise up-builded than the gate of the heavenly homes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himseems that the gate-wards know him, for they cry out each to each,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as whispering winds in the mountains he hears their far-off speech.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he comes to the gate's huge hollow, and amidst its twilight goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his horse is glad and remembers, and that road of King-folk knows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the winds are astir in its arches with the sound of swords unseen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cries of kings departed, and the battles that have been.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So into a garth of warriors from that dusk he rideth out<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span><span class="i0">And no man stayeth nor hindereth; there he gazeth round about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seeth a glorious dwelling, a mighty far-famed place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the last of the evening sunlight shines fair on his weary face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there is a hall before him, and huge in the even it lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mountain grey and awful with the Dwarf-folk's masteries:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the houses of men cling round it, and low they seem and frail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the wise and the deft have built them for a long-enduring tale:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the wind sings loud in the wall-nook, and the spears are sparks on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the swords are flaming torches as the sun is hard on his fall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He falls, and the even dusketh o'er that sword-renown&egrave;d close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sigurd bideth and broodeth for the Niblung house he knows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he hath a thought within him that he rideth forth from shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that men have forgotten the greeting and are slow to remember his fame.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But forth from the hall came a shouting, and the voice of many men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he deemed they cried "Hail, Sigurd! thou art welcome home again!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he looked to the door of the feast-hall and behold it seemed to him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That its wealth of graven stories with more than the dusk was dim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the waving of white raiment and the doubtful gleam of gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then there groweth a longing within him, nor his heart will he withhold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he rideth straight to the doorway, and the stories of the door:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there sitteth Giuki the ancient, the King, the wise of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Grimhild the kin of the God-folk, the wife of the glittering eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there is the goodly Gunnar, and Hogni the overwise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Guttorm the young and the war-fain; and there in the door and the shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eyes to the earth cast downward, is the white-armed Niblung Maid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all these give Sigurd greeting, and hail him fair and well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And King Giuki saith:<br /></span>
<span class="i8">"Hail, Sigurd! what tidings wilt thou tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thy deeds since yestereven? or whitherward wentst thou?"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He spread out his hands before them, and he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i22">"O, what be ye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who ask of the deeds of Sigurd, and seek of the days to be?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are ye aught but the Niblung children? for meseems I would ask for a gift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the thought of my heart is unstable, and my hope as the winter-drift;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the words may not be shapen.&mdash;But speak ye, men of the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have ye any new-found tidings, or are deeds come nigh to the birth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are there knots for my sword to sunder? are there thrones for my hand to shake?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to which of the Gods shall I give, and from which of the Kings shall I take?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or in which of the houses of man-folk henceforward shall I dwell?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O speak, ye Niblung children, and the tale to Sigurd tell!"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">None answered a word for a space; but Gudrun wept in the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the noise of men came outward and of feet that went on the floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Grimhild stood before him, and took him by the hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she said: "In the hall are gathered the earls of the Niblung land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come thou with the Mother of Kings and sit in thy place tonight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the cheer of the earls may be bettered, nor the war-dukes lose delight."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And rang back from the glassy pillars, and the woven God-folk stirred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And afar the clustering eagles on the golden roof-ridge heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried out on the Sword of the Branstock as they cried in other days;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the harps rang out in the hall, and men sang in Sigurd's praise.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Save that great was the flood of sorrow that had drowned his days of good:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he deemed that the sons of the earl-folk, e'en mid their praising word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were looking on his trouble as a people sore afeard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gifts that the Gods had given the pride in his soul awoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kindled was Sigurd's kindness by the trouble of the folk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he thought: I shall do and undo, as while agone I did,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And abide the time of the dawning, when the night shall be no more hid!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he lifted his head like a king, and his brow as a God's was clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the trouble fell from the people, and they cast aside their fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scarce was his glory abated as he sat in the seat of the Kings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the Niblung brethren about him, and they spake of famous things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dealings of lords of the earth; but he spake and answered again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrust by the grief of forgetting, and his tangled thought and vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cast his care on the morrow, that the people might be glad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet no smile there came to Sigurd, and his lips no laughter had;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he seemeth a king o'er-mighty, who hath won the earthly crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In whose hand the world is lying, who no more heedeth renown.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If he turn his face from her sorrow, and wend on his lonely ways.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she sees the change in his eyen, and her queenly grief is stirred,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And he saith:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nay, put thy trouble from thee, lest the shielded warriors grieve!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or tell me what hath been done, or what deed have men forborne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That here mid the warriors' joyance thy life-joy lieth forlorn?<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He seeth the love in her eyen, and the life that is tangled in his,<br /></span>

<h4>Of the Wedding of Sigurd the Volsung.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That night sleeps Sigurd the Volsung, and awakes on the morrow-morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wots at the first but dimly what thing in his life hath been born:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the sun cometh up in the autumn, and the eve he remembered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the word he hath given to Gudrun to love her to the death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he longs for the Niblung maiden, that her love may cherish his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest e'en as a Godhead banished he dwell in the world apart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The new sun smiteth his body as he leaps from the golden bed,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span><span class="i0">And doeth on his raiment and is fair apparelled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he goes his ways through the chambers, and greeteth none at all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he comes to the garth and the garden in the nook of the Niblung wall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now therein, mid the yellowing leafage, and the golden blossoms spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone and lovely and eager the white-armed Gudrun went;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift then he hasteneth toward her, and she bideth his drawing near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now in the morn she trembleth; for her love is blent with fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wonder is all around her, for she deemed till yestereve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she saw the earls astonied, and the golden Sigurd grieve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That on some most mighty woman his joyful love was set;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love hath made her humble, and her race doth she forget,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her noble and mighty heart from the best of the Niblungs sprung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sons of the earthly War-Gods of the days when the world was young.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea she feareth her love and his fame, but she feareth his sorrow most,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest he spake from a heart o'erladen and counted not the cost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lo, the love of his eyen, and the kindness of his face!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joy her body burdens, and she trembleth in her place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sinks in the arms that cherish with a faint and eager cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And again on the bosom of Sigurd doth the head of Gudrun lie.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fairer than yestereven doth Sigurd deem his love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more her tender wooing and her shame his soul doth move;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his words of peace and comfort come easier forth from him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And woman's love seems wondrous amidst his trouble dim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange, sweet, to cling together! as oft and o'er again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They crave and kiss rejoicing, and their hearts are full and fain.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then a little while they sunder, and apart and anigh they stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sigurd's eyes grow awful as he stretcheth forth his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his clear voice saith:<br /></span>
<span class="i10">"O Gudrun, now hearken while I swear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the sun shall die for ever and the day no more be fair.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span><span class="i0">Ere I forget thy pity and thine inmost heart of love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, though the Kings be mighty, and the Gods be great above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will wade the flood and the fire, and the waste of war forlorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To look on the Niblung dwelling, and the house where thou wert born."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Strange seemed the words to Sigurd that his gathering love compelled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet and strange desire o'er his tangled trouble welled.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But bright flashed the eyes of Gudrun, and she said: "King, as for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou sawest the heart in my bosom, what oath might better thee?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet my words thy words shall cherish, as thy lips my lips have done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Herewith I swear, O Sigurd, that the earth shall hate the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the year desire but darkness, and the blossoms shrink from day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere my love shall fail, beloved, or my longing pass away!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now they go from the garth and the garden, and hand in hand they come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the hall of the kings of aforetime, and the heart of the Niblung home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There they go 'neath the cloudy roof-tree, and on to the high-seat fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there sitteth Giuki the ancient, and the guileful Grimhild is there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the swart-haired Niblung brethren; and all these are exceeding fain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they look on Sigurd and Gudrun, and the peace that enwrappeth the twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For in her is all woe forgotten, sick longing little seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the shame that slayeth pity, and the self-scorn of a Queen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all doubt in love is swallowed, and lovelier now is she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than a picture deftly painted by the craftsmen over sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her face is a rose of the morning by the night-tide framed about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the long-stored love of her bosom from her eyes is leaping out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But how fair is Sigurd the King that beside her beauty goes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How lovely is he shapen, how great his stature shows!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How kind is the clasping right-hand, that hath smitten the battle acold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How kind are the awful eyen that no foeman durst behold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How sweet are the lips unsmiling, and the brow as the open day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What man can behold and believe it, that his life shall pass away?<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span><span class="i0">So he standeth proud by the high-seat, and the sun through the vast hall pours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Gods on the hangings waver as the wind goes by the doors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And abroad are the sounds of man-folk, and the eagles cry from the roof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the ancient deeds of Sigmund seem fallen far aloof;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dead are the fierce days fallen, and the world is soft and sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the Son of the Volsungs speaketh in noble words and meet:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O hearken, King of the Niblungs, O ancient of the days!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time was, when alone I wandered, and went on the wasteland ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sore my soul desired the harvest of the sword:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I slew the great Gold-wallower, and won the ancient Hoard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I turned to the dwellings of men; for I longed for measureless fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to do and undo with the Kings, and the pride of the Kings to tame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I longed for the love of the King-folk; but who desired my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who stayed my feet in his dwelling, who showed the weary the goal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who drew me forth from the wastes, and the bitter kinless dearth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I came to the house of Giuki and the hallowed Niblung hearth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Count up the deeds and forbearings, count up the words of the days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That show forth the love of the Niblungs and the ancient people's praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, number the waves of the sea, and the grains of the yellow sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the drops of the rain in the April, and the blades of the grassy land!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what if one heart of the Niblungs had stored and treasured it all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hushed, and moved but softly, lest one grain thereof should fall?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If she feared the barren garden, and the sunless fallow field?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How then should the spring-tide labour, and the summer toil to yield!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so may the high Gods help me, as I from this day forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall toil for her exalting to the height of worldly worth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou stretch thine hands forth, Giuki, and hail me for thy son:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then there as thou sitt'st in thy grave-mound when thine earthly day is done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt hear of our children's children, and the crown&egrave;d kin of kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the peace of the Niblung people in the day of better things;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then mayst thou be merry of the eve when Sigurd came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the day of the deeds of the Niblungs and the blossom of their fame,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span><span class="i0">Stretch forth thine hands to thy son: for I bid thy daughter to wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her life shall withhold my death-day, and her death shall stay my life."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then spoke the ancient Giuki: "Hail, Sigurd, son of mine eld!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I bless the Gods for the day that mine ancient eyes have beheld:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now let me depart in peace, since I know for very sooth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That waxen e'en as the God-folk shall the Niblungs blossom in youth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, take thy mother's greeting, and let thy brethren say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How well they love thee, Sigurd, and how fair they deem the day."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then lowly bendeth Sigurd 'neath the guileful Grimhild's hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he kisseth the Kings of the Niblungs, and about him there they stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The war-fain, darkling kindred; and all their words are praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the love of the tide triumphant, and the hope of the latter days.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hark now, on the morrow morning how the blast of the mighty horn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the builded Burg of the Niblungs goes over the acres shorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the roads are gay with the riders, and the bull in the stall is left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the plough is alone in the furrow, and the wedge in the hole half-cleft;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And late shall the ewes be folded, and the kine come home to the pail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And late shall the fires be litten in the outmost treeless dale:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For men fare to the gate of Giuki and the ancient cloudy hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therein are the earls assembled and the kings wear purple and pall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the flowers are spread beneath them, and the bench-cloths beaten with gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the walls are strange and wondrous with the noble stories told:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For new-hung is the ancient dwelling with the golden spoils of the south,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men seem merry for ever, and the praise is in each man's mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the name of Sigurd the Volsung, the King and the Serpent's Bane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who exalteth the high this morning and blesseth the masters of gain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For men drink the bridal of Sigurd and the white-armed Niblung maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the best with the best shall be mingled, and the gold with the gold o'erlaid.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, fair in the hall is the feasting and men's hearts are uplifted on high,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span><span class="i0">And they deem that the best of their life-days are surely drawing anigh,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And their well-belov&egrave;d voices awake the hoped-for sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the midmost of the high-tide, and the joy of feasting lords.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then cometh a hush and a waiting, and the light of many swords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flows into the hall of Giuki by the doorway of the King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And amid those flames of battle the war-clad warriors bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Cup of daring Promise and the hallowed Boar of S&ocirc;n,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And unwinds the knitted peace-strings that hamper Regin's Sword:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then fierce is the light on the high-seat as men set down the Cup<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anigh the hand of Sigurd, and the edges blue rise up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fall on the hallowed Wood-beast: as a trump of the woeful war<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And he comes, and the face unfashioned his ruth and his mercy must hide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She trembled and wept before him, till at last amidst her tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joy and the hope of women fell on her unawares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she sought the hands that had held her, and the face that her face had blessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bosom of Sigurd the Mighty, the hope of her earthly rest.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he spake as she hearkened and wondered: "With the Kings of men I rode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And none but the men of the war-fain our coming swords abode:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, dear was the day of the riding, and the hope of the clashing swords!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, dear were the deeds of battle, and the fall of Odin's lords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I met the overcomers, and beheld them overcome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we rent the spoil from the spoilers, and led the chasers home!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, sweet was the day of the summer when we won the ancient towns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we stood in the golden bowers and took and gave the crowns!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet were the suppliant faces, and the gifts and the grace we gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the life and the wealth unhoped for, and the hope to heal and save:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet was the praise of the Niblungs, and dear was the song that arose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the deed assured, accomplished, and the death of the people's foes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O joyful deeds of the mighty! O wondrous life of a King!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto thee alone will I tell it, and his fond imagining,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That but few of the people wot of, as he sits with face unmoved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the place where kings have perished, in the seat of kings beloved!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His kind arms clung about her, and her face to his face he drew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The life of the kings have I conquered, but this is strange and new;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from out the heart of the striving a lovelier thing is born,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span><span class="i0">And the love of my love is sweeter and these hours before the morn."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Again she trembled before him and knew not what she feared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her heart alone, unhidden, deemed her love too greatly dared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the very body of Sigurd, the wonder of all men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cast cherishing arms about her, and kissed her mouth again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in love her whole heart melted, and all thought passed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save the thought of joy's fulfilment and the hours before the day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She murmured words of loving as his kind lips cherished her breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the world waxed nought but lovely and a place of infinite rest.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But it was long thereafter ere the sun rose o'er their love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lit the world of autumn and the pale sky hung above;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it stirred the Gods in the heavens, and the Kings of the Goths it stirred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the sound of the world awakening in their latter dreams they heard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over the Burg of the Niblungs the day spread fair and fresh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the hopes of the ancient people and those twain become one flesh.<br /></span>

<h4>Sigurd rideth with the Niblungs, and wooeth Brynhild for
King Gunnar.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now it fell on a day of the spring-tide that followed on these things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Sigurd fares to the meadows with Gunnar and Hogni the Kings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For afar is Guttorm the youngest, and he sails the Eastern Seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fares with war-shield hoisted to win him fame's increase.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So come the Kings to the Doom-ring, and the people's Hallowed Field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no dwelling of man is anigh it, and no acre forced to yield;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There stay those Kings of the people alone in weed of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they cut a strip of the greensward on the meadow's daisied floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loosen it clean in the midst, while its ends in the earth abide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they heave its midmost aloft, and set on either side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ancient spear of battle writ round with words of worth;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span><span class="i0">And these are the posts of the door, whose threshold is of the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the skin of the earth is its lintel: but with war-glaives gleaming bare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Niblung Kings and Sigurd beneath the earth-yoke fare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then each an arm-vein openeth, and their blended blood falls down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Earth the fruitful Mother where they rent her turfy gown:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then, when the blood of the Volsungs hath run with the Niblung blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They kneel with their hands upon it and swear the brotherhood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each man at his brother's bidding to come with the blade in his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the fire and the flood should sunder, and the very Gods withstand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each man to love and cherish his brother's hope and will;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each man to avenge his brother when the Norns his fate fulfill:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now are they foster-brethren, and in such wise have they sworn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the God-born Goths of aforetime, when the world was newly born.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But among the folk of the Niblungs goes forth the tale of the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men deem the tidings a glory and the garland of their fame.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So is Sigurd yet with the Niblungs, and he loveth Gudrun his wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wendeth afield with the brethren to the days of the dooming of life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nought his glory waneth, nor falleth the flood of praise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To every man he hearkeneth, nor gainsayeth any grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glad is the poor in the Doom-ring when he seeth his face mid the Kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the tangle straighteneth before him, and the maze of crook&egrave;d things.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the smile is departed from him, and the laugh of Sigurd the young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of few words now is he waxen, and his songs are seldom sung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howbeit of all the sad-faced was Sigurd loved the best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men say: Is the king's heart mighty beyond all hope of rest?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, how he beareth the people! how heavy their woes are grown!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So oft were a God mid the Goth-folk, if he dwelt in the world alone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Giuki the King of the Niblungs must change his life at the last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they lay him down in the mountains and a great mound over him cast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thus had he said in his life-days: "When my hand from the people shall fade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up there on the side of the mountains shall the King of the Niblungs be laid,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span><span class="i0">Whence one seeth the plain of the tillage and the fields where man-folk go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then whiles in the dawn's awakening, when the day-wind riseth to blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I see the war-gates opening, and the joy of my shielded men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they look to the field of the dooming: and whiles in the even again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I see the spoil come homeward, and the host of the Niblungs pour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the gates that the Dwarf-folk builded and the well-belov&egrave;d door."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So there lieth Giuki the King, mid steel and the glimmer of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the sound of the feastful Niblungs round his misty house is rolled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Gunnar is King of the people, and the chief of the Niblung land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man beloved for his mercy, and his might and his open hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glorious king in the battle, a hearkener at the doom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A singer to sing the sun up from the heart of the midnight gloom.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On a day sit the Kings in the high-seat when Grimhild saith to her son:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O Gunnar, King belov&egrave;d, a fair life hast thou won;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the flood, in the field hast thou wrought, and hung the chambers with gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far abroad mid many a people are the tidings of thee told:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now do a deed for thy mother and the hallowed Niblung hearth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest the house of the mighty perish, and our tale grow wan with dearth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou do the deed that I bid thee, and wed a wife of the Kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No less shalt thou cleave the war-helms and scatter the ruddy rings."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He said: "Meseemeth, mother, thou speaketh not in haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hast sought and found beforehand, lest thy fair words fall to waste."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She said: "Thou sayest the sooth; I have found the thing I sought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Maid for thee is shapen, and a Queen for thee is wrought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the waste land hard by Lymdale a marvellous hall is built,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With its roof of the red gold beaten, and its wall-stones over-gilt:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Afar o'er the heath men see it, but no man draweth nigher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the garth that goeth about it is nought but the roaring fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A white wall waving aloft; and no window nor wicket is there,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span><span class="i0">Whereby the shielded earl-folk or the sons of the merchants may fare:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But few things from me are hidden, and I know in that hall of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sits Brynhild, white as a wild-swan where the foamless seas are rolled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the daughter of Kings of the world, and the sister of Queens is she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wise, and Odin's Chooser, and the Breath of Victory:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for this cause sitteth she thus in the ring of the Wavering Flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That no son of the Kings will she wed save the mightiest master of fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the man who knoweth not fear, and the man foredoomed of fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ride through her Wavering Fire to the door of her golden gate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for him she sitteth and waiteth, and him shall she cherish and love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the Kings of the world should withstand it, and the Gods that sit above.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak thou, O mighty Gunnar!&mdash;nay rather, Sigurd my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say who but the lord of the Niblungs should wed with this glorious one?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Long Sigurd gazeth upon her, and slow he sayeth again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I know thy will, my mother; of all the sons of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all the Kings unwedded, and the kindred of the great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is meet that my brother Gunnar should ride to her golden gate."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then laughed Gunnar and answered: "May a king of the people fear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May a king of the harp and the hall-glee hold such a maid but dear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet nought have I and my kindred to do with fateful deeds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, how the fair earth bloometh, and the field fulfilleth our needs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our swords rust not in our scabbards, and our steeds bide not in the stall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft are the shields of the Niblungs drawn clanking down from the wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I sit by my brother Sigurd, and no ill there is in our life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the harp and the sword is beside me, and I joy in the peace and the strife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I live, till at last in the sword-play midst the uttermost longing of fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall change my life and be merry, and leave no hated name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet nevertheless, my mother, since the word has thus gone forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I wot of thy great desire, I will reach at this garland of worth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I bid you, Kings and Brethren, with the wooer of Queens to ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ye tell of the thing hereafter, and the deeds that shall betide."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"It were well, O Son," said Grimhild, "in such fellowship to fare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not today nor tomorrow; the hearts of the Gods would I wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And know of the will of the Norns; for a mighty matter is this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a deed all lands shall tell of, and the hope of the Niblung bliss."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So apart for long dwelt Grimhild, and mingled the might of the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the deeds of the chilly sea, and the heart of the cloudland's dearth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all these with the wine she mingled, and sore guile was set therein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blindness, and strong compelling for such as dared to win:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she gave the drink to her sons; and withal unto Gunnar she spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And told him tales of the King-folk, and smote desire awake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till many a time he bethinks him of the Maiden sitting alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Queen that was shapen for him; till a dream of the night is she grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a tale of the day's desire, and the crown of all his praise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the net of the Norns was about him, and the snare was spread in his ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his mother's will was spurring adown the way they would;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she was the wise of women and the framer of evil and good.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the May-morn riseth Gunnar with fair face and gleaming eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he calleth on Sigurd his brother, and he calleth on Hogni the wise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Today shall we fare to the wooing, for so doth our mother bid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We shall go to gaze on marvels, and things from the King-folk hid."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they do on the best of their war-gear, and their steeds are dight for the road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forth to the sun neigheth Greyfell as he neighed 'neath the Golden Load:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But or ever they leap to the saddle, while yet in the door they stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereto cometh Grimhild the wise-wife, and on each head layeth her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she saith: "Be mighty and wise, as the kings that came before!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they knew of the ways of the Gods, and the craft of the Gods they bore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they knew how the shapes of man-folk are the very images<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the hearts that abide within them, and they knew of the shaping of these.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be wise and mighty, O Kings, and look in mine heart and behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The craft that prevaileth o'er semblance, and the treasured wisdom of old!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And tonight shall be the weaving, and tomorn the web shall ye win."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they leap to the saddles aloft, and they ride and speak no word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the hills and the dales are awakened by the clink of the sheath&egrave;d sword:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None looks in the face of the other, but the earth and the heavens gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And behold those kings of battle ride down the dusty ways.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they come to the Waste of Lymdale when the afternoon is begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And afar they see the flame-blink on the grey sky under the sun:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they spur and speak no word, and no man to his fellow will turn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they see the hills draw upward and the earth beginning to burn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they ride, and the eve is coming, and the sun hangs low o'er the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the red flame roars up to it from the midst of the desert's dearth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None turns or speaks to his brother, but the Wrath gleams bare and red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blood-red is the Helm of Aweing on the golden Sigurd's head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bare is the blade of Gunnar, and the first of the three he rides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wavering wall is before him and the golden sun it hides.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the heart of a king's son failed not, but he tossed his sword on high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laughed as he spurred for the fire, and cried the Niblung cry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the mare's son saw and imagined, and the battle-eager steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That so oft had pierced the spear-hedge and never failed at need,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrank back, and shrieked in his terror, and spite of spur and rein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fled fast as the foals unbitted on Odin's pasturing plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wide then he wheeled with Gunnar, but with hand and knee he dealt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the voice of a lord belov&egrave;d, till the steed his master felt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bore him back to the brethren; by Greyfell Sigurd stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stared at the heart of the fire, and his helm was red as blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Hogni sat in his saddle, and watched the flames up-roll;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he said: "Thy steed has failed thee that was once the noblest foal<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span><span class="i0">In the pastures of King Giuki; but since thine heart fails not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou wouldst not get thee backward and say, The fire was hot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the voices pent within it were singing nought but death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let Sigurd lend thee his steed that wore the Glittering Heath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And carried the Bed of the Serpent, and the ancient ruddy rings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So perchance may the mocks be lesser when men tell of the Niblung Kings."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd looked on the twain, and he saw their swart hair wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the wind of the waste and the flame-blast, and no answer awhile he gave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at last he spake: "O brother, on Greyfell shalt thou ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And do on the Helm of Aweing and gird the Wrath to thy side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cover thy breast with the war-coat that is throughly woven of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hath not its like in the heavens nor has earth of its fellow told:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this is the raiment of Kings when they ride the Flickering Fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so sink the flames before them and the might of their desire."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Hogni laughed in his heart, and he said: "This changing were well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If so might the deed be accomplished; but perchance there is more to tell:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt take the war-steed, Gunnar, and enough or nought it shall be:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the coal-blue gear of the Niblungs the golden hall shall see."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd looked on the speaker, as one who would answer again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his words died out on the waste and the fire-blast made them vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he casteth the reins to his brother, and Gunnar praiseth his gift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And springeth aloft to the saddle as the fair sun fails from the lift;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sigurd looks on the burden that Greyfell doth uprear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The huge king towering upward in the dusky Niblung gear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There sits the eager Gunnar, and his heart desires the deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of nought he recketh and thinketh, but a fame-stirred warrior's need;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Greyfell trembleth nothing and nought of the fire doth reck:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the spurs in his flank are smitten, and the reins lie loose on his neck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sharp cry springeth from Gunnar&mdash;no handbreadth stirred the beast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dusk drew on and over and the light of the fire increased,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Was the shape of the cloudy Greyfell, nor moved he more than the stone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But right through the heart of the fire for ever Sigurd stared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he stood in the gold red-litten with the Wrath's thin edges bared.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No word for a while spake any, till Gunnar leaped to the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the anger wrought within him, and the fierce words came to birth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Who mocketh the King of the Niblungs in the desert land forlorn?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it thou, O Sigurd the Stranger? is it thou, O younger-born?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dost thou laugh in the hall, O Mother? dost thou spin, and laugh at the tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That has drawn thy son and thine eldest to the sword and the blaze of the bale?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or thou, O God of the Goths, wilt thou hide and laugh thy fill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the hands of the fosterbrethren the blood of brothers spill?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the awful voice of Sigurd across the wild went forth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"How changed are the words of Gunnar! where wend his ways of worth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mock thee not in the desert, as I mocked thee not in the mead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I swore beneath the turf-yoke to help thy fondest need:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, strengthen thine heart for the work, for the gift that thy manhood awaits;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I give thee a gift, O Niblung, that shall overload the Fates,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Till they come to the Burg of the Niblungs and the war-gate of their pride;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She heard the name, and she changed not, but her feet went forth as he led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And under the cloudy roof-tree Queen Brynhild bowed her head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, were there a man so ancient as had lived beyond his peers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the earth, that beareth all things, a twice-told tale of years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had heard no sound so mighty as the shout that shook the wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Brynhild's feet unhearkened first trod the Niblung hall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No whit the clamour stirred her; but her godlike eyes she raised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And betwixt the hedge of the earl-folk on the golden high-seat gazed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ere the first of the tempest ariseth the latter sun doth shroud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men look round and shudder, so Grimhild came between<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silent golden Sigurd and the eyes of the mighty Queen,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When he swore the love that endureth, and the truth that knoweth not change;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Though it further thine own hope nothing, and thy longing be empty and vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, thou hungerest after mine husband!&mdash;yet greatly art thou wed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And high o'er the kings of the Goth-folk doth Gunnar rear the head."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Which one of the sons of Giuki," said Brynhild, "durst to ride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the waves of my Flickering Fire to lie by Brynhild's side?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shouldst know him, O Sister of Kings; let the glorious name be said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest mine oath in the water be written, and I wake up, vile and betrayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the arms of the faint-heart dastard, and of him that loveth life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And casteth his deeds to another, and the wooing of his wife."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yea, hearken," said she of the Niblungs, "what words the stranger saith!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear the words of the fool of love, how she feareth not the death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor to cry the shame on Gunnar, whom the King-folk tremble before:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wise and the overcomer, the crown of happy war!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said Brynhild: "Long were the days ere the Son of Sigmund came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long were the days and lone, but nought I dreamed of the shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So may the day come, Grimhild, when thine eyes know not thy son!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think then on the man I knew not, and the deed thy guile hath done!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then coldly laughed Queen Gudrun, and she said: "Wilt thou lay all things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the woman that hath loved thee and the Mother of the Kings?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O all-wise Queen of the Niblungs, was this change too hard a part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the learned in the lore of Regin, who ate of the Serpent's heart?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then was Brynhild silent a little, and forth from the Niblung hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came the sound of the laughter of men to the garth by the nook of the wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a wind arose in the twilight, and sounds came up from the plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of kine in the dew-fall wandering, and of oxen loosed from the wain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the songs of folk free-hearted, and the river rushing by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the heart of Brynhild hearkened and she cried with a grievous cry:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Sigurd, O my Sigurd, we twain were one, time was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wide world lay before us and the deeds to bring to pass!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now I am nought for helping, and no helping mayst thou give;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all is marred and evil, and why hast thou heart to live?"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She held her peace for anguish, and forth from the hall there came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shouts of the joyous Niblungs, and the sound of Sigurd's name:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Brynhild turned from Gudrun, and lifted her voice and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O evil house of the Niblungs, may the day of your woe and your dread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be meted with the measure of the guile ye dealt to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When ye sealed your hearts from pity and forgat my misery!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And she turned to flee from the garden; but her gown-lap Gudrun caught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried: "Thou evil woman, for thee were the Niblungs wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their day of the fame past telling, that they should heed thy life?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear house of the Niblung glory, fair bloom of the warriors' strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How well shalt thou stand triumphant, when all we lie in the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a little while remembered in the story of thy worth!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the lap of her linen raiment did Brynhild tear from her hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spake from her mouth brought nigher, and her voice was low and cold:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Such pride and comfort in Sigurd henceforward mayst thou find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such joy of his life's endurance, as thou leav'st me joy behind!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But turmoil of wrath wrapt Gudrun, that she knew not the day from the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she hardened her heart for evil as the warriors when they smite:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she cried: "Thou filled with murder, my love shall blossom and bloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou liest in the hell forgotten! smite thence from the deedless gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smite thence at the lovely Sigurd, from the dark without a day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the hand that death hath loosened the King of Glory slay!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So died her words of anger, and her latter speech none heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save the wind of the early night-tide and the leaves by its wandering stirred;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For amidst her wrath and her blindness was the hapless Brynhild gone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she fled from the Burg of the Niblungs and cried to the night alone:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Sigurd, O my Sigurd, what now shall give me back<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span><span class="i0">One word of thy loving-kindness from the tangle and the wrack?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Norns, fast bound from helping, O Gods that never weep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye have left stark death to help us, and the semblance of our sleep!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I sleep and remember Sigurd; and I wake and nought is there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save the golden bed of the Niblungs, and the hangings fashioned fair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I stretch out mine hand to take it, that sleep that the sword-edge gives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How then shall I come on Sigurd, when again my sorrow lives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the dreams of the slumber of death? O nameless, measureless woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To abide on the earth without him, and alone from earth to go!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So wailed the wife of Gunnar, as she fled through the summer night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And unwitting around she wandered, till again in the dawning light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stood by the Burg of the Niblungs, and the dwelling of her lord.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Awhile bode the white-armed Gudrun on the edge of the daisied sward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till she shrank from the lonely flowers and the chill, speech-burdened wind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she turned to the house of her fathers and her golden chamber kind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for long by the side of Sigurd hath she lain in light-breathed sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While yet the winds of night-tide round the wandering Brynhild sweep.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On the morrow awakeneth Gudrun; and she speaketh with Sigurd and saith:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For what cause is Brynhild heavy, and as one who abideth but death?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yea," Sigurd said, "is it so? as a great queen she goes upon earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thoughtful of weighty matters, and things that are most of worth."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It was other than this," said Gudrun, "that I deemed her yesterday;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Is it so?" said Sigurd the Volsung, "Ah, I sore misdoubt me then,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span><span class="i0">That thereof shall we hear great tidings that shall be for the ruin of men."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Why grieveth she so," said Gudrun, "a queen so mighty and wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Chooser of the war-host, the desire of many eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Queen of the glorious Gunnar, the wife of the man she chose?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she sits by his side on the high-seat, as the lily blooms by the rose."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Where then in the world was Brynhild," said he, "when she spake that word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said that her belov&egrave;d was her very earthly lord?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then was Sigurd silent a little, and Gudrun spake no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For despite the heart of the Niblungs, and her love exceeding sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fear her soul was smitten for the word that Sigurd spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet more for his following silence; and the stark death seemed to awake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stride through the Niblung dwelling, and the sunny morn grew dim:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, lo, the voice of the Volsung, and the speech came forth from him:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hearken, Gudrun my wife; the season is nigh at hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, the day is now on the threshold, when thou alone in the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shalt answer for Sigurd departed, and shalt say that I loved thee well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet if thou hear'st men say it, then true is the tale to tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Brynhild was my belov&egrave;d in the tide and the season of youth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as great as is thy true-love, e'en so was her love and her truth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for this cause thus have I spoken, that the tale of the night hast thou told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cast the word unto Brynhild, and shown her the token of gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;A deed for the slaying of many, and the ending of my life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since I betrayed her unwitting.&mdash;Yet grieve not, Gudrun my wife!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For cloudy of late were the heavens with many a woven lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now is the clear of the twilight, when the slumber draweth anigh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But call up the soul of the Niblungs, and harden thine heart to bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For wert thou not sprung from the mighty, today were thy portion of fear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, thou wottest it even as I; but I see thine heart arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the soul of the mighty Niblungs, and fair is the love in thine eyes."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then forth went the King from the chamber to the council of the Kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he sat with the wise in the Doom-ring for the sifting of troublous things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rejoiced the heart of the people: and the Wrath kept watch by his side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his eyen were nothing dimmer than on many a joyous tide.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But abed lay Brynhild the Queen, as a woman dead she lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no word for better or worse to the best of her folk would she say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they bore the tidings to Gunnar, and said: "Queen Brynhild ails<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a sickness whereof none knoweth, and death o'er her life prevails."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then uprose Gunnar the Niblung, and he went to Brynhild his wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prayed her to strengthen her heart for the glory of his life:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she gave not a word in answer, nor turned to where he stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there rose up a fear in his heart, and he looked for little of good:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There he bode for a long while silent, and the thought within him stirred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wise speech of his mother Grimhild, and many a warning word:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i6">"Art thou smitten of God, unto whom shall we cast the prayer?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art thou wronged by one of the King-folk, for whom shall the blades be bare?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Belike she never heard him; she lay in her misery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the slow tears gushed from her eyen and nought of the world would she see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ill thoughts arose in Gunnar, and remembrance of the speech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Erst spoken low by Grimhild; yet he turned his heart to beseech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he spake again:<br /></span>
<span class="i8">"O Brynhild, if I ever made thee glad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the glory of the great-ones of my gift thine heart hath had.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As mine heart hath been faithful to thee, as I longed for thy life-days' gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell now of thy toil and thy trouble that we each of each may be fain!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nought spake she, nothing she moved, and the tears were dried on her cheek;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the very words of Grimhild did Gunnar's memory seek;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sought and he found and considered; and mighty he was and young,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span><span class="i0">And he thought of the deeds of his fathers and the tales of the Niblungs sung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How they bore no God's constraining, and rode through the wrong and the right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the storm of their wrath might quicken, and their tempest carry the light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The words of his mother he gathered and the wrath-flood over him rolled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with it came many a longing, that his heart had never told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, scarce to himself in the night-tide, for the gain of the ruddy rings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fame of the earth unquestioned and the mastery over kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he sole King in the world-throne, unequalled, unconstrained;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with wordless wrath he fretted at the bonds that his glory had chained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bitter anger stirred him, and at last he spake and cried:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How long, O all-wise Brynhild, like the dead wilt thou abide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor speak to thy lord and thy husband and the man that rode thy Fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mocked at the bane of King-folk to accomplish thy desire?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I deem thou sickenest, Brynhild, with the love of a mighty-one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The foe, the King's supplanter, he that so long hath shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mid the honour of our fathers, and the lovely Niblung house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a serpent amidst of the treasure that the day makes glorious."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet never a word she answered, nor unto the great King turned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till through all the patience of King-folk the flame of his anger burned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his voice was the rattling thunder, as he cried across the bed:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O who art thou, fearful woman? art thou one of the first of the dead?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast thou long ago seen and hated the tide of the Niblung praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clad thee in flesh twice over for the bane of our happy days?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art thou come from the far-off country that none may live and behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the bane of the King of the Niblungs, and of Sigurd lord of the Gold?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she raised herself on her elbow and turned her eyes on the King:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O tell me, Gunnar," she said, "that thou gavest Andvari's Ring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thy sister the white-armed Gudrun!&mdash;thou, not thy captain of war,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span><span class="i0">The son of the God-born Volsungs, the Lord of the Treasure of yore!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And weave with the wisdom of women, and broider the purple and pall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And look in thy face at the chess-play, and drink of thy carven cup,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whisper a word in season when the voice of the wise goes up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And speak thee the speech of kindness by the hallowed Niblung hearth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O swear it, King of the Niblungs, lest thine honour die of the dearth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O swear it, lord I have wedded, lest mine honour come to nought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I be but a wretch and a bondmaid for a year's embracing bought!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Till his heart hath heard her meaning at the golden bed he stares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the last of the words she speaketh flit empty past his ears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he knows that the tale of the night-tide hath been told and understood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now of her shame was he deeming e'en worse than Brynhild would.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he turns from her face and the chamber with his glory so undone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he saith the Gods did evil when the mighty work they won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wrought the Burg of the Niblungs, and fashioned his fathers' days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And led them on to the harvest of the deeds and the people's praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nought he sees to amend it, save the hungry eyeless sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the war without hope or honour, and the strife without reward.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So alone he goeth his ways, and the morn to the noontide falls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sun goeth down in the heavens, and fades from the Niblung walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dusk and the dark draw over, and no man the King may see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sigurd sits in the hall mid the war-dukes' company:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone of the Kings in the Doom-ring, and the council of the wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the street and the wharf and the burg-gate he shines in the people's eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stately and lovely to look on he heareth of good and of ill,<br /></span>

<h4>Of the exceeding great grief and mourning of Brynhild.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the sun cometh up in the morning and shines o'er holt and heath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wall of the mighty mountains, and the sheep-fed slopes beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the horse-fed plain and the river, and the acres of the wheat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the herbs of bane and of healing, and the garden hedges sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It shines on the sea and the shepherd, and the husbandman's desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the Niblung Burg it shineth and smiteth the vanes afire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in Gudrun's bower it shineth, and seeth small joy therein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For hushed the fair-clad maidens the work of women win;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Gudrun looketh about her, and she saith:<br /></span>
<span class="i18">"Why sit ye so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I hearken but creak of the loom-stock and the battens' homeward blow?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why is your joy departed and your sweet speech fallen dumb?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are the Niblungs fled from the battle, is their war-host overcome?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have the Norns given forth their shaming? have they fallen in the fight?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the sun shines notwithstanding, and the world around is bright."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then answered a noble woman, and the wise of maids was she:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou knowest, O lovely lady, that nought of this may be;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then the wife of Sigurd answered: "Arise and go thy way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the chamber of Queen Brynhild, and bid her wake at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that long have we slept and slumbered, and the deedless night is passed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bid her wake to the deeds of queen-folk, and be glad as the world-queens are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they look on the people that loves them, and thrust all trouble afar.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then arose the light-foot maiden: but she stayed and spake by the door:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the days of her life are numbered, and her might is waxen weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she lieth as one forsaken, and no word her lips will speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, not to her lord that loveth: but all we deem, O Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the wrath of the Gods is upon her for ancient deeds unseen."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nought answered the white-armed Gudrun, but the fear in her soul arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she thought of the golden Sigurd, and the compassing of foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And great grew the dread of her maidens as they gazed upon her face:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she rose and looked not backward as she hastened from her place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sought the King of the Niblungs by hall and chamber and stair,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On his knees was the breadth of the sunshine, and thereon lay the edges pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The war-flame of the Niblungs, the sword that his right hand knew:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That my heart is grieved with her grief and I mourn for her evil day."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Gunnar answered her word, but his words were heavy and slow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou know'st not the words thou speakest&mdash;and wherefore should I go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since I am forbidden to share it, the woe or the weal of her heart?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look thou on the King of the Niblungs, how he sitteth alone and apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast bound in the wiles of women, and the web that a traitor hath spun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no deed for his hand he knoweth, or to do or to leave undone."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The coal-blue gear of the Niblungs, and the sword o'er his knees there lay:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She sickened, and said: "What dost thou? what then is the day and the deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the sword on thy knees is naked, and thou clad in the warrior's weed?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I will nowise go in unto Brynhild, lest the evil tide grow worse.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the speech on her lips was ready, till the chill fear made it nought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For apart and alone was he sitting in all his war-gear clad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Fafnir's Helm of Aweing, and Regin's Wrath he had,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over the breast of Sigurd was the Hauberk all of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hath not the like in the heavens nor has earth of its fellow told.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A chill, an untimely hour for the blooming of our bliss!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go in to my sister Brynhild, and tell her of very sooth<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And there sitteth Sigurd the Volsung in the gold and the harness of war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was won from the heart-wise Fafnir and the guarded Treasure of yore,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And cried out for need and rejoicing; till, lo, the rim of the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showed over the eastern ridges, and the new day was begun;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then bright as the flames of the heaven the Helm of Aweing gleamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then clashed the red rings of the Treasure, as Sigurd stood on his feet,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"It is truer to tell," said Sigurd, "that mine heart in thy love was enwrapped<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When the stroke of the sword hath been smitten, and the night hath seen me die:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then belike in thy fresh-springing wisdom thou shalt know of the dark and the deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the snare for our feet fore-ordered from whence they shall never be freed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for me, in the net I awakened and the toils that unwitting I wove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no tongue may tell of the sorrow that I had for thy wedded love:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I dwelt in the dwelling of kings; so I thrust its seeming apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I laboured the field of Odin: and e'en this was a joy to my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we dwelt in one house together, though a stranger's house it were."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O late, and o'erlate!" cried Brynhild&mdash;"may the dead folk hearken and hear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All was and today it is not&mdash;And the Oath unto Gunnar is sworn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I live the days twice over, and the life thou hast made forlorn?"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And she heard the words of Hindfell and the oath of the earlier day,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And my heart is the forge of sorrow, and my life is a wasting dearth."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then once again spake Sigurd, once only and no more:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pillar of light all golden he stood on the sunlit floor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his eyes were the eyes of Odin, and his face was the hope of the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his voice was the thunder of even when the bolt o'er the mountains is hurled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fairest of all things fashioned he stood 'twixt life and death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Wrath of Regin rattled, and the rings of the Glittering Heath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i6">"I am Sigurd the Volsung, and belike the tale shall be true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That no hand on the earth may hinder what my hand would fashion and do:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what God or what man shall gainsay it if our love be greater than these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pride and the glory of Sigurd, and the latter days' increase?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O live, live, Brynhild belov&egrave;d! and thee on the earth will I wed,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span><span class="i0">And put away Gudrun the Niblung&mdash;and all those shall be as the dead."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But so swelled the heart within him as he cast the speech abroad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the golden wall of the battle, the fence unrent by the sword.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The red rings of the uttermost ocean on the breast of Sigurd brake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he saw the eyes of Brynhild, and turned from the word she spake:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I will not wed thee, Sigurd, nor any man alive."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Sigurd goes out from before her; and the winds in the wall-nook strive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the craving of fowl and the beast-kind with the speech of men is blent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the voice of the sons of the Niblungs; and their day's first hour is spent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he goes through the hall of the War-dukes, and many an earl is astir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But none durst question Sigurd lest of evil days he hear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he comes to his kingly chamber, and there sitteth Gudrun alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fear in her soul is minished, but the love and the hatred are grown:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She is wan as the moonlit midnight; but her heart is cold and proud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she asketh him nought of Brynhild, and nought he speaketh aloud.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But his heart in the mid-mirk waded, as through the halls he strode,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then in through the door strode Guttorm fair-clad in hunter's guise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With no steel save his wood-knife girded; but his war-fain eyes stared wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he spake: "What words are ye hiding from the youngest Niblung child?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What work is to win, my brethren, that ye sit in warrior's weed,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span><span class="i0">And tell me nought of the glory, and cover up the deed?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then uprose Grimhild the wise-wife, and took the cup again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night-long had she brewed that witch-drink and laboured not in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For therein was the creeping venom, and hearts of things that prey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the hidden lives of ocean, and never look on day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the heart of the ravening wood-wolf and the hunger-blinded beast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the spent slaked heart of the wild-fire the guileful cup increased:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But huge words of ancient evil about its rim were scored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The curse and the eyeless craving of the first that fashioned sword.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the cup in her hand was gleaming, as she turned unto Guttorm and spake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Be merry, King of the War-fain! we hold counsel for thy sake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The work is a God's son's slaying, and thine is the hand that shall smite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thy name may be set in glory and thy deeds live on in light."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Forth flashed the flame from his eyen, and he cried: "Where then is the foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This dread of mine house and my brethren, that my hand may lay him alow?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Drink, son," she said, "and be merry! and I shall tell his name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose death shall crown thy life-days, and increase thy fame with his fame."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He drinketh and craveth for battle, and his hand for a sword doth seek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he looketh about on his brethren, but his lips no word may speak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They speak the name, and he hears not, and again he drinks of the cup<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knows not friend nor kindred, and the wrath in his heart wells up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That no God may bear unmingled, and he cries a wordless cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the last of the day is departing and the dusk time drawing anigh.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Grimhild goes from the chamber, and bringeth his harness of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therewith they array his body, and he drinketh the cup once more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his heart is set on the murder, and now may he understand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What soul is dight for the slaying, and what quarry is for his hand.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span><span class="i0">For again, they tell him of Sigurd, and the man he remembereth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And praiseth his mighty name and his deeds that laughed on death.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now dusk and dark draw over, and through the glimmering house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They go to the place of the Niblungs, the high hall and glorious;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For hard by is the chamber of Sigurd: there dight in their harness of war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their thrones sit Gunnar and Hogni, but Guttorm stands on the floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his blue blade naked before them: the torches flare from the wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the woven God-folk waver, but the hush is deep in the hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those Niblung faces change not, though the slow moon slips from her height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And earth is acold ere dawning, and new winds shake the night.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now it was in the earliest dawn-dusk that Guttorm stirred in his place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the mail-rings tinkled upon him, as he turned his helm-hid face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And went forth from the hall and the high-seat; but the Kings sat still in their pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hearkened the clash of his going and heeded how it died.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Slow, all alone goeth Guttorm to Sigurd's chamber door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all is open before him, and the white moon lies on the floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bed where Sigurd lieth with Gudrun on his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And light comes her breath from her bosom in the joy of infinite rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Guttorm stands on the threshold, and his heart of the murder is fain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he thinks of the deeds of Sigurd, and praiseth his greatness and gain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright blue is his blade in the moonlight&mdash;but lo, how Sigurd lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the carven dead that die not, with fair wide-open eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their glory gleameth on Guttorm, and the hate in his heart is chilled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he shrinketh aback from the threshold and knoweth not what he willed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But his brethren heed and hearken, and they hear the clash draw nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they stir no whit in their pride, though the lord of all creatures should die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they see where cometh Guttorm, but they cast him never a word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For white 'neath the flickering torches they see his unstained sword;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he gazed on those Kings of the kindred, and the beast of war awoke;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span><span class="i0">And his heart was exceeding wrathful with the tarrying of the stroke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he strode to the chamber of Sigurd, and again they heeded well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How the clash, in the cloister awakened, by the threshold died and fell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Guttorm gazed from the threshold, and the moon was fading away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the golden bed of Sigurd, and the Niblung woman lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the bosom of the Volsung, and her hand lay light on her lord;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But dread were his eyes wide-open, and they gleamed against the sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Guttorm shrank from before them, and back to the hall he came:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the biding brethren behold him flash wild in the torches' flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor stir their lips to question; but their swords on their knees are laid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The torches faint in the dawning, and they see his unstained blade.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now dieth moon and candle, and though the day be nigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roof of the hall fair-builded seems far aloof as the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a glimmer grows on the pavement and the ernes on the roof-ridge stir:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the brethren hist and hearken, for a sound of feet they hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And into the hall of the Niblungs a white thing cometh apace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the sword of Guttorm upriseth, and he wendeth from his place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the clash of steel goes with him; yet loud as it may sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still more they hear those footsteps light-falling on the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hearts of the Niblungs waver, and their pride is smitten acold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they look on that latest comer, and Brynhild they behold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she sits by their side in silence, and heeds them nothing more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the grey soft-footed morning heeds yester-even's war.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Guttorm clashed in the cloisters and through the silence strode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scarce on the threshold of Sigurd a little while abode:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the moon from the floor hath departed and heaven without is grey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And afar in the eastern quarter faint glimmer streaks of day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close over the head of Sigurd the Wrath gleams wan and bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Niblung woman stirreth, and her brow is knit with fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the King's closed eyes are hidden, loose lie his empty hands,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span><span class="i0">There is nought 'twixt the sword of the slayer and the Wonder of all Lands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Guttorm laughed in his war-rage, and his sword leapt up on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he sprang to the bed from the threshold and cried a wordless cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with all the might of the Niblungs through Sigurd's body thrust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turned and fled from the chamber, and fell amid the dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the door and without it, the slayer slain by the slain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the cast of the sword of Sigurd had smitten his body atwain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While yet his cry of onset through the echoing chambers went.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Woe's me! how the house of the Niblungs by another cry was rent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wakening wail of Gudrun, as she shrank in the river of blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the breast of the mighty Sigurd: he heard it and understood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rose up on the sword of Guttorm, and turned from the country of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spake words of loving-kindness as he strove for life and breath:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wail not, O child of the Niblungs! I am smitten, but thou shalt live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In remembrance of our glory, mid the gifts the Gods shall give!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She stayed her cry to hearken, and her heart well nigh stood still:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he spake: "Mourn not, O Gudrun, this stroke is the last of ill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear leaveth the House of the Niblungs on this breaking of the morn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mayst thou live, O woman belov&egrave;d, unforsaken, unforlorn!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he sank aback on the sword, and down to his lips she bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If some sound therefrom she might hearken; for his breath was well-nigh spent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"It is Brynhild's deed," he murmured, "and the woman that loves me well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nought now is left to repent of, and the tale abides to tell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have done many deeds in my life-days, and all these, and my love, they lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the hollow hand of Odin till the day of the world go by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have done and I may not undo, I have given and I take not again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art thou other than I, Allfather, wilt thou gather my glory in vain?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was silence then in the chamber, as the dawn spread wide and grey,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span><span class="i0">And hushed was the hall of the Niblungs at the entering-in of day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long Gudrun hung o'er the Volsung and waited the coming word;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she stretched out her hand to Sigurd and touched her love and her lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the broad day fell on his visage, and she knew she was there alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her heart was wrung with anguish and she uttered a weary moan:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Brynhild laughed in the hall, and the first of men's voices was that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since when on yester-even the kings in the high-seat had sat.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the wrath of Gunnar was kindled and the words of the king out-brake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Woe's me, thou wonder of women! thou art glad for no man's sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay not for thine own, meseemeth, for thou bidest here as the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the pale ones stricken deedless, whose tale of life is sped."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She hearkened him not nor answered; and day came on apace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they heard the anguish of Gudrun and her voice in the ancient place.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Awake, O House of the Niblungs! for my kin hath slain my lord.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the house rose rumour and stir, and men stood up in the morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their hearts with doubt were shaken, as if with the Uttermost Horn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cry and the calling spread, and shields clashed down from the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swords in the chamber glittered, and men ran apace to the hall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor knew what man to question, nor who had tidings to give,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the spears in the hall were tossing as the rye in the windy plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they look aloft to the high-seat and they see the gleam of the gold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Gunnar the King of battle, and Hogni wise and cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Brynhild the wonder of women; and her face is deadly pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Kings are clad in their war-gear, and bared are the edges of bale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then cold fear falleth upon them, but the noise and the clamour abate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they look on the war-wise Gunnar and awhile for his word they wait;<br /></span>

<h4>Of the mighty Grief of Gudrun over Sigurd dead.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of old in the days past over was Gudrun blent with the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she sat in measureless sorrow o'er Sigurd's wasted bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no sigh came from her bosom, nor smote she hand in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wailed with the other women, and the daughters of the land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the wise of the Earls beheld her, smit cold with her dread intent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they rose one after other, and before the Queen they went;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men ancient, men mighty in battle, men sweet of speech were there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they loved her, and entreated, and spake good words to hear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no tears and no lamenting in Gudrun's heart would strive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the deadly chill of sorrow that none may bear and live.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now there were the King-folk's daughters, and wives of the Earls of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fair, and the noble-hearted, the wise in ancient lore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they rose one after other, and stood before the Queen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell of their woes past over, and the worst their eyes had seen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was Giaflaug, Giuki's sister, she was old and stark to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she said:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Look up, O child of the Niblungs, and hearken mournful things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the woes of living man-folk and the daughters of the Kings!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dead now is the last of my brethren; to the dead my sister went;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My son and my little daughter in the earliest days were spent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the earth am I living loveless, long past are the happy days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They lie with things departed and vain and foolish praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hopes of hapless people: yet I sit with the people's lords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When men are hushed to hearken the least of all my words.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What else is the wont of the Niblungs? why else by the Gods were they wrought,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Yet all we live to love thee, and the glory of the Queen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look up, look up, O Gudrun! what rest for them that wail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the Queens of men shall tremble, and the God-kin faint and fail?"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Because of her love departed, and the day with nought to do.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The billows beat on the bulwarks and took what the battle gave:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone I sang above them, alone I dight their gear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the uttermost journey of all men, in the harvest of the year:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wakened spring from winter ere I left those early dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bound hands and shameful body I went as the sea-thieves led:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now I sit by the hearth of a stranger; nor have I weal nor woe,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No wailing word gat Gudrun, no thought she had to weep<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Since her love was taken from her and the day of deeds to do.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Gudrun's eyes fell on it, and she saw the bright-one's hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All wet with the deadly dew-fall, and she saw the great eyes stare<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span><span class="i0">At that cloudy roof of the Niblungs without a smile or frown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she saw the breast of the mighty and the heart's wall rent adown:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She gazed and the woe gathered on her, so exceeding far away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed all she once had cherished from that which near her lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She gazed, and it craved no pity, and therein was nothing sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therein was clean forgotten the hope that Sigurd had:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she looked around and about her, as though her friend to find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And met those woeful faces but as grey reeds in the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she turned to the King beneath her and raised her hands on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fell on the body of Sigurd with a great and bitter cry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All else in the house kept silence, and she as one alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spared not in that kingly dwelling to wail aloud and moan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sound of her lamentation the peace of the Niblungs rent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the restless birds in the wall-nook their song to the green leaves sent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the geese in the home-mead wandering clanged out beneath the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now was the day's best hour, and its loveliest tide begun.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Long Gudrun lay on Sigurd, and her tears fell fast on the floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the rain in midmost April when the winter-tide is o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till she heard a wail anigh her and how Gullrond wept beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she knew the voice of her pity, and rose upright and cried:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O ye, e'en such was my Sigurd among these Giuki's sons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the hart with the horns day-brightened mid the forest-creeping ones;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the spear-leek fraught with wisdom mid the lowly garden grass;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the gem on the gold band's midmost when the council cometh to pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the King is lit with its glory, and the people wonder and praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;O people, Ah thy craving for the least of my Sigurd's days!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O wisdom of my Sigurd! how oft I sat with thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou striver, thou deliverer, thou hope of things to be!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O might of my love, my Sigurd! how oft I sat by thy side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was praised for the loftiest woman and the best of Odin's pride!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now am I as little as the leaf on the lone tree left,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then her speech grew wordless wailing, and no man her meaning knew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till she hushed her swift and turned her; for a laugh her wail pierced through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a whistling shaft the night-wind in some foe-encompassed wood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo, by the nearest pillar the wife of Gunnar stood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There stood the allwise Brynhild 'gainst the golden carving pressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she stared at the wound of Sigurd and that rending of his breast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she felt the place fallen silent, and the speechless anger set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On her own chill, bitter sorrow; and the eyes of the women met,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they stood in the hall together, as they stood that while ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they twain in Brynhild's dwelling of days to come would know:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But every soul kept silence, and all hearts were chill as stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Brynhild spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i8">"Thou woman, shall thine eyes be wet alone?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shalt thou weep and speak in thy glory, when I may weep no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I speak, and my speech is as silence to the man that loved me sore?"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then folk heard the woe of Gudrun, and the bitterness of hate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Day cursed o'er every other! when they opened wide the gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Kings in gold arrayed them, and all men the joy might hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Greyfell neighed in the forecourt the world's delight to bear,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lo, the deeds of the sons of Giuki for the latter days of doom!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O hearken, hearken Gunnar! May the dear Gold drag thee adown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Greyfell's ruddy Burden, and the Treasure of renown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rings that ye swore the oath on! yea, if all avengers die,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And may no man draw anigh it to tell of the ruin and the wrack!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, may I be a mock for the idle if my feet come ever aback,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If my heart think kind of the chambers, if mine eyes shall yearn to behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fair-built house of my fathers, the house beloved of old!"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then she waileth out before them, and hideth her face from the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she casteth her down from the high-seat and fleeth fast away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forth from the Hall of the Niblungs, and forth from the Burg is she gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forth from the holy dwellings, and a long way forth alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till she comes to the lonely wood-waste, the desert of the deer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the feet of the lonely mountains, that no man draweth anear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the wolves are about and around her, and death seems better than life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And folding the hands and forgetting a merrier thing than strife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for long and long thereafter no man of Gudrun knows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor who are the friends of her life-days, nor whom she calleth her foes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But how great in the hall of the Niblungs is the voice of weeping and wail!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men bide on the noon's departing, men bide till the eve shall fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they wend one after other to the sleep that all men win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till few are the hall-abiders, and the moon is white therein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no sound in the house may ye hearken save the ernes that stir o'erhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the far-off wail o'er Guttorm and the wakeners o'er the dead:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still by the carven pillar doth the all-wise Brynhild stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-gaze on the wound of Sigurd, nor moveth foot nor hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor speaketh word to any, of them that come or go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round the evil deed of the Niblungs and the corner-stone of woe.<br /></span>

<h4>Of the passing away of Brynhild.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Once more on the morrow-morning fair shineth the glorious suns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Niblung children labour on a deed that shall be done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For out in the people's meadows they raise a bale on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The oak and the ash together, and thereon shall the Mighty lie;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor gold nor steel shall be lacking, nor savour of sweet spice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor cloths in the Southlands woven, nor webs of untold price:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The work grows, toil is as nothing; long blasts of the mighty horn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the topmost tower out-wailing o'er the woeful world are borne.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Brynhild lay in her chamber, and her women went and came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they feared and trembled before her, and none spake Sigurd's name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whiles they deemed her weeping, and whiles they deemed indeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she spake, if they might but hearken, but no words their ears might heed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till at last she spake out clearly:<br /></span>
<span class="i14">"I know not what ye would;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ye come and go in my chamber, and ye seem of wavering mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thrust me on, or to stay me; to help my heart in woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to bid my days of sorrow midst nameless folly go."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">None answered the word of Brynhild, none knew of her intent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she spake: "Bid hither Gunnar, lest the sun sink o'er the bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave the words unspoken I yet have will to speak."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then her maidens go from before her, and that lord of war they seek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he stands by the bed of Brynhild and strives to entreat and beseech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But her eyes gaze awfully on him, and his lips may learn no speech.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she saith:<br /></span>
<span class="i6">"I slept in the morning, or I dreamed in the waking-hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my dream was of thee, O Gunnar, and the bed in thy kingly bower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the house that I blessed in my sorrow, and cursed in my sorrow and shame,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span><span class="i0">The gates of an ancient people, the towers of a mighty name:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King, cold was the hall I have dwelt in, and no brand burned on the hearth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dead-cold was thy bed, O Gunnar, and thy land was parched with dearth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I saw a great King riding, and a master of the harp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he rode amidst of the foemen, and the swords were bitter-sharp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his hand in the hand-gyves smote not, and his feet in the fetters were fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While many a word of mocking at his speechless face was cast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I heard a voice in the world: 'O woe for the broken troth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the heavy Need of the Niblungs, and the Sorrow of Odin the Goth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I saw the halls of the strangers, and the hills, and the dark-blue sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor knew of their names and their nations, for earth was afar from me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But brother rose up against brother, and blood swam over the board,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And women smote and spared not, and the fire was master and lord.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, then was the moonless mid-mirk, and I woke to the day and the deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deed that earth shall name not, the day of its bitterest need.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many words have I said in my life-days, and little more shall I say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye have heard the dream of a woman, deal with it as ye may:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For meseems the world-ways sunder, and the dusk and the dark is mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I come to the hall of Freyia, where the deeds of the mighty shall shine.'"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So hearkened Gunnar the Niblung, that her words he understood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he knew she was set on the death-stroke, and he deemed it nothing good:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he said: "I have hearkened, and heeded thy death and mine in thy words:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have done the deed and abide it, and my face shall laugh on the swords;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thee, woman, I bid thee abide here till thy grief of soul abate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meseems nought lowly nor shameful shall be the Niblung fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here shalt thou rule and be mighty, and be queen of the measureless Gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And abase the kings and upraise them; and anew shall thy fame be told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as fair shall thy glory blossom as the fresh fields under the spring."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he casteth his arms about her, and hot is the heart of the King<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the glory of Queen Brynhild and the hope of her days of gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he clean forgetteth Sigurd and the foster-brother slain:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span><span class="i0">But she shrank aback from before him, and cried: "Woe worth the while<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the thoughts ye drive back on me, and the memory of your guile!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Kings of earth were gathered, the wise of men were met;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the death of a woman's pleasure their glorious hearts were set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I was alone amidst them&mdash;Ah, hold thy peace hereof!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest the thought of the bitterest hours this little hour should move."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He rose abashed from before her, and yet he lingered there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she said: "O King of the Niblungs, what noise do I hearken and hear?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why ring the axes and hammers, while feet of men go past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shields from the wall are shaken, and swords on the pavement cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the door of the treasure is opened; and the horn cries loud and long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the feet of the Niblung children to the people's meadows throng?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His face was troubled before her, and again she spake and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Meseemeth this is the hour when men array the dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou tell me tidings, Gunnar, that the children of thy folk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pile up the bale for Guttorm, and the hand that smote the stroke?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He said: "It is not so, Brynhild; for that Giuki's son was burned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the moon of the middle heaven last night toward dawning turned."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They looked on each other and spake not; but Gunnar gat him gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And came to his brother Hogni, the wise-heart Giuki's son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spake: "Thou art wise, O Hogni; go in to Brynhild the queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stay her swift departing; or the last of her days hath she seen."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It is nought, thy word," said Hogni; "wilt thou bring dead men aback,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the souls of kings departed midst the battle and the wrack?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet this shall be easier to thee than the turning Brynhild's heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She came to dwell among us, but in us she had no part;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let her go her ways from the Niblungs with her hand in Sigurd's hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will the grass grow up henceforward where her feet have trodden the land?"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O evil day," said Gunnar, "when my queen must perish and die!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Such oft betide," saith Hogni, "as the lives of men flit by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the evil day is a day, and on each day groweth a deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a thing that never dieth; and the fateful tale shall speed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo now, let us harden our hearts and set our brows as the brass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest men say it, 'They loathed the evil and they brought the evil to pass.'"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they spake, and their hearts were heavy, and they longed for the morrow morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the morrow of tomorrow, and the new day yet to be born.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Brynhild cried to her maidens: "Now open ark and chest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And draw forth queenly raiment of the loveliest and the best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red rings that the Dwarf-lords fashioned, fair cloths that queens have sewed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To array the bride for the mighty, and the traveller for the road."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They wept as they wrought her bidding and did on her goodliest gear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she laughed mid the dainty linen, and the gold-rings fashioned fair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She arose from the bed of the Niblungs, and her face no more was wan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a star in the dawn-tide heavens, mid the dusky house she shone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they that stood about her, their hearts were raised aloft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid their fear and wonder: then she spake them kind and soft:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now give me the sword, O maidens, wherewith I sheared the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the Kings of Earth were gathered to know the Chooser's mind."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All sheathed the maidens brought it, and feared the hidden blade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the naked blue-white edges across her knees she laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spake: "The heaped-up riches, the gear my fathers left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All dear-bought woven wonders, all rings from battle reft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All goods of men desired, now strew them on the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so share among you, maidens, the gifts of Brynhild's store."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They brought them mid their weeping, but none put forth a hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take that wealth desired, the spoils of many a land:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There they stand and weep before her, and some are moved to speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they cast their arms about her and strive with her, and beseech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she look on her loved-ones' sorrow and the glory of the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was nought; she scarce might see them, and she put their hands away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she said: "Peace, ye that love me! and take the gifts and the gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In remembrance of my fathers and the faithful deeds of old."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she spake: "Where now is Gunnar, that I may speak with him?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For new things are mine eyes beholding and the Niblung house grows dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And new sounds gather about me, that may hinder me to speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the breath is near to flitting, and the voice is waxen weak."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then upright by the bed of the Niblungs for a moment doth she stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the blade flasheth bright in the chamber, but no more they hinder her hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than if a God were smiting to rend the world in two:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then dulled are the glittering edges, and the bitter point cleaves through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breast of the all-wise Brynhild, and her feet from the pavement fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sigh of her heart is hearkened mid the hush of the maidens' wail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chill, deep is the fear upon them, but they bring her aback to the bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her hand is yet on the hilts, and sidelong droopeth her head.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then there cometh a cry from withoutward, and Gunnar's hurrying feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are swift on the kingly threshold, and Brynhild's blood they meet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low down o'er the bed he hangeth and hearkeneth for her word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her heavy lids are opened to look on the Niblung lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she saith:<br /></span>
<span class="i6">"I pray thee a prayer, the last word in the world I speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ye bear me forth to Sigurd, and the hand my hand would seek;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bale for the dead is builded, it is wrought full wide on the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is raised for Earth's best Helper, and thereon is room for twain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye have hung the shields about it, and the Southland hangings spread,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But ere ye leave us sleeping, draw his Wrath from out the sheath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lay that Light of the Branstock, and the blade that frighted deaths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt my side and Sigurd's, as it lay that while agone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When once in one bed together we twain were laid alone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How then when the flames flare upward may I be left behind?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How then may the road he wendeth be hard for my feet to find?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How then in the gates of Valhall may the door of the gleaming ring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clash to on the heel of Sigurd, as I follow on my king?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she raised herself on her elbow, but again her eyelids sank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wound by the sword-edge whispered, as her heart from the iron shrank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she moaned: "O lives of man-folk, for unrest all overlong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the Father were ye fashioned; and what hope amendeth a wrong?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now at last, O my belov&egrave;d, all is gone; none else is near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the ages of all ages, never sundered, shall we wear."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Scarce more than a sigh was the word, as back on the bed she fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor was there need in the chamber of the passing of Brynhild to tell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no more their lamentation might the maidens hold aback,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the sound of their bitter mourning was as if red-handed wrack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran wild in the Burg of the Niblungs, and the fire were master of all.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the voice of Gunnar the war-king cried out o'er the weeping hall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Wail on, O women forsaken, for the mightiest woman born!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the hearth is cold and joyless, and the waste bed lieth forlorn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wail on, but amid your weeping lay hand to the glorious dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That not alone for an hour may lie Queen Brynhild's head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For here have been heavy tidings, and the Mightiest under shield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is laid on the bale high-builded in the Niblungs' hallowed field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fare forth! for he abideth, and we do Allfather wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the shining Valhall's pavement await their feet o'erlong."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then they took the body of Brynhild in the raiment that she wore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And out through the gate of the Niblungs the holy corpse they bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thence forth to the mead of the people, and the high-built shielded bale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then afresh in the open meadows breaks forth the women's wail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they see the bed of Sigurd and the glittering of his gear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fresh is the wail of the people as Brynhild draweth anear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tidings go before her that for twain the bale is built,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That for twain is the oak-wood shielded and the pleasant odours spilt.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is peace on the bale of Sigurd, and the Gods look down from on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they see the lids of the Volsung close shut against the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he lies with his shield beside him in the Hauberk all of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That has not its like in the heavens, nor has earth of its fellow told;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forth from the Helm of Aweing are the sunbeams flashing wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sheath&egrave;d Wrath of Sigurd lies still by his mighty side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then cometh an elder of days, a man of the ancient times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is long past sorrow and joy, and the steep of the bale he climbs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he kneeleth down by Sigurd, and bareth the Wrath to the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the beams are gathered about it, and from hilt to blood-point run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wide o'er the plain of the Niblungs doth the Light of the Branstock glare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the wondering mountain-shepherds on that star of noontide stare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fear for many an evil; but the ancient man stands still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the war-flame on his shoulder, nor thinks of good or of ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the feet of Brynhild's bearers on the topmost bale are laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her bed is dight by Sigurd's; then he sinks the pale white blade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lays it 'twixt the sleepers, and leaves them there alone&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, the last that shall ever behold them,&mdash;and his days are well nigh done.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then is silence over the plain; in the noon shine the torches pale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the best of the Niblung Earl-folk bear fire to the builded bale:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a wind in the west ariseth, and the white flames leap on highs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with one voice crieth the people a great and mighty cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men cast up hands to the Heavens, and pray without a word,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span><span class="i0">As they that have seen God's visage, and the face of the Father have heard.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They are gone&mdash;the lovely, the mighty, the hope of the ancient Earth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It shall labour and bear the burden as before that day of their birth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It shall groan in its blind abiding for the day that Sigurd hath sped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hour that Brynhild hath hastened, and the dawn that waketh the dead:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It shall yearn, and be oft-times holpen, and forget their deeds no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the new sun beams on Baldur, and the happy sealess shore.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hear now of those Niblung war-kings, how in glorious state they dwell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They do and undo at their pleasure and wear their life-days well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They deal out doom to the people, and their hosts of war array,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor storm nor wind nor winter their eager swords shall stay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They ride the lealand highways, they ride the desert plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They cry out kind to the Sea-god and loose the wave-steed's rein:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They climb the unmeasured mountains, and gleam on the world beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their swords are the blinding lightning, and their shields are the shadow of death:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When men tell of the lords of the Goth-folk, of the Niblungs is their word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All folk in the round world's compass of their mighty fame have heard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are lords of the Ransom of Odin, the uncounted sea-born Gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Grief of the wise Andvari, the Death of the Dwarfs of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gleaming Load of Greyfell, the ancient Serpent's Bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The store of the days forgotten, by the dead heaped up for the dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, such are the Kings of the Niblungs, but yet they crave and desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest the world hold greater than they, lest the Gods and their kindred be higher.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fair, bright is their hall in the even; still up to the cloudy roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There goeth the glee and the singing while the eagles chatter aloof,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span><span class="i0">And the Gods on the hangings waver in the doubtful wind of night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still fair are the linen-clad damsels, still are the war-dukes bright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men come and go in the even; men come and go in the morn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good tidings with the daybreak, fair fame with the glooming is born:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;But no tidings of Sigurd and Brynhild, and whoso remembereth their days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns back to the toil or the laughter from his words of lamenting or praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns back to the glorious Gunnar, casts hope on the Niblung name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doeth deeds from the morn to the even, and beareth no burden of shame.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well wedded is Gunnar the King, and Hogni hath wedded a wife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair queens are those wives of the Niblungs, good helpmates in peace and in strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet they sit on the golden high-seat, and Grimhild sitteth beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the years have made her glorious, and the days have swollen her pride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She looketh down on the people, from on high she looketh down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her days have become a wonder, and her redes are wisdom's crown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She saith: Where then are the Gods? what things have they shapen and made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More of might than the days I have shapen? of whom shall our hearts be afraid?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now there was a King of the outlands, and Atli was his name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lord of a mighty people, a man of marvellous fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who craved the utmost increase of all that kings desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who would reach his hand to the gold as it ran in the ruddy fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or go down to the ocean-pavement to harry the people beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or cast up his sword at the Gods, or bid the friendship of death.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By hap was the man unwedded, and wide in the world he sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a queen to increase his glory lest his name should come to nought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no kin like the kin of the Niblungs he found in all the earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No treasure like their treasure, no glory like their worth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he sendeth an ancient war-duke with a goodly company,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And three days they ride the mirk-wood and ten days they sail the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And three days they ride the highways till they come to Gunnar's land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there on an even of summer in Gunnar's hall they stand,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span><span class="i0">And the spears of Welshland glitter, and the Southland garments gleam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For those folk are fair apparelled as the people of a dream.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the glorious Son of Giuki from amidst the high-seat spoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why stand ye mid men sitting, or fast mid feasting folk?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No meat nor drink there lacketh, and the hall is long and wide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three days in the peace of the Niblungs unquestioned shall ye bide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then timely do your message, and bid us peace or war."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But spake the Earl of Atli yet standing on the floor:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"All hail, O glorious Gunnar, O mighty King of men!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-short is the life of man-folk, the three-score years and ten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long, long is the craft for the learning, and sore doth the right hand waste:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, lord, our spurs are bloody, and our brows besweat with haste;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our gear is stained by the sea-spray and rent by bitter gales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we struck no mast to the tempest, and the East was in our sails;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the thorns is our raiment rended, for we rode the mirk-wood through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our steeds were the God-bred coursers, nor day from night-tide knew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, we are the men of Atli, and his will and his spoken word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lies not beneath our pillow, nor hangs above the board;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, how shall it fail but slay us if three days we hold it hid?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;I will speak to-night, O Niblung, save thy very mouth forbid:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lo now, look on the tokens, and the rune-staff of the King."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then spake the Son of Giuki: "Give forth the word and the thing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since thy faithfulness constraineth: but I know thy tokens true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thy rune-staff hath the letters that in days agone I knew."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then this is the word," said the elder, "that Atli set in my mouth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I have known thee of old, King Gunnar, when we twain drew sword in the south<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the days of thy father Giuki, and great was the fame of thee then:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now it rejoiceth my heart that thou growest the greatest of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And anew I crave thy friendship, and I crave a gift at thy hands,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span><span class="i0">That thou give me the white-armed Gudrun, the queen and the darling of lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be my wife and my helpmate, my glory in hall and afield;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That mine ancient house may blossom and fresh fruit of the King-tree yield.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I send thee gifts moreover, though little things be these.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But such is the fashion of great-ones when they speak across the seas.'"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then cried out that earl of the strangers, and men brought the gifts and the gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White steeds from the Eastland horse-plain, fine webs of price untold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge pearls of the nether ocean, strange masteries subtly wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the hands of craftsmen perished and people come to nought.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Gunnar laughed and answered: "King Atli speaketh well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the sea, peradventure, I too a tale may tell:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now born is thy burden of speech; so rejoice at the Niblung board,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For here art thou sweetly welcome for thyself and thy mighty lord:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And maybe by this time tomorrow, or maybe in a longer space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall ye have an answer for Atli, and a word to gladden his face."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the strangers sit and are merry, and the Wonder of the East<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the glory of the Westland kissed lips in the Niblung feast.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But again on the morrow-morning speaks Gunnar with Grimhild and saith:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Where then in the world is Gudrun, and is she delivered from death?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For nought hereof hast thou told me: but the wisest of women art thou,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I deem that all things thou knowest, and thy cunning is timely now;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For King Atli wooeth my sister; and as wise as thou mayst be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What thing mayst thou think of greater 'twixt the ice and the uttermost sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the might of the Niblung people, if this wedding come to pass?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then answered the mighty Grimhild, and glad of heart she was:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"It is sooth that Gudrun liveth; for that daughter of thy folk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fled forth from the Burg of the Niblungs when the Volsung's might ye broke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She fled from all holy dwellings to the houses of the deer,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span><span class="i0">And the feet of the mountains deserted that few folk come anear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the wolves were about and around her, and no mind she had to live;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dull sleep she deemed was better than with turmoiled thought to strive:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there rode a wife in the wood, a queen of the daughters of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she came where Gudrun abided, whose might was minished as then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till she was as a child forgotten; nor that queen might she gainsay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who took the white-armed Gudrun, and bore my daughter away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her burg o'er the hither mountains; there she cherished her soft and sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till she rose, from death delivered, and went upon her feet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She awoke and beheld those strangers, a trusty folk and a kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A goodly and simple people, that few lords of war shall find:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glorious and mighty they deemed her, as an outcast wandering God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she loved their loving-kindness, and the fields of the tiller she trod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And went 'twixt the rose and the lily, and sat in the chamber of wool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smiled at the laughing maidens, and sang over shuttle and spool.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seven seasons there hath she bided, and this have I wotted for long;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I knew that her heart is as mine to remember the grief and the wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the days of thy sister I told not, in her life would I have no part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest a foe for thy life I should fashion, and sharpen a sword for thine heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now is the day of our deeds, and no longer durst I refrain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest I put the Gods' hands from me, and make their gifts but vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, the woman is of the Niblungs, and often I knew her of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How her heart would burn within her when the tale of their glory was told.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wisdom and craft shall I work, with the gifts that Odin hath given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherewith my fathers of old, and the ancient mothers have striven."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thy word is good," quoth Gunnar, "a happy word indeed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, how shall I fear a woman, who have played with kings in my need?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, how may I speak of my sister, save well remembering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How goodly she was aforetime, how fair in everything,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How kind in the days passed over, how all fulfilled of love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the glory of the Niblungs, and the might that the world shall move?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She shall see my face and Hogni's, she shall yearn to do our will,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span><span class="i0">And the latter days of her brethren with glory shall fulfil."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Grimhild laughed and answered: "Today then shalt thou ride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the dwelling of Thora the Queen, for there doth thy sister abide."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As she spake came the wise-heart Hogni, and that speech of his mother he heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he said: "How then are ye saying a new and wonderful word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ye meddle with Gudrun's sorrow, and her grief of heart awake?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will ye draw out a dove from her nest, and a worm to your hall-hearth take?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What then," said his brother Gunnar, "shall we thrust by Atli's word?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall we strive, while the world is mocking, with the might of the Eastland sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the wise are mocking to see it, how the great devour the great?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O wise-heart Hogni," said Grimhild, "wilt thou strive with the hand of fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrust back the hand of Odin that the Niblung glory will crown?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wert thou born in a cot-carle's chamber, or the bed of a King's renown?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I know not, I know not," said Hogni, "but an unsure bridge is the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such would I oft were builded betwixt my foeman and me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know a sorrow that sleepeth, and a wakened grief I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the torment of the mighty is a strong and fearful foe."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They spake no word before him; but he said: "I see the road;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see the ways we must journey&mdash;I have long cast off the load,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The burden of men's bearing wherein they needs must bind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All-eager hope unseeing with eyeless fear and blind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So today shall my riding be light; nor now, nor ever henceforth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall men curse the sword of Hogni in the tale of the Niblung worth."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Therewith he went out from before them, and through chamber and hall he cried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the best of the Niblung earl-folk, for that now the Kings would ride:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon are all men assembled, and their shields are fresh and bright,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span><span class="i0">Nor gold their raiment lacketh; then the strong-necked steeds they dight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They dight the wain for Grimhild, and she goeth up therein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the well-clad girded maidens have left the work they win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sit by the Mother of Kings and make her glory great:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to horse get the Kings of the Niblungs, and ride out by the ancient gate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And amidst its dusky hollows stir up the sound of swords:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth then from the hallowed houses ride on those war-fain lords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they come to the dales deserted, and the woodland waste and drear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the wood-wolves shrink before them, fast flee the forest-deer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the stony wood-ways clatter as the Niblung host goes by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adown by the feet of the mountains that eve in sleep they lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And arise on the morrow-morning and climb the mountain-pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sunless hollow places, and the slopes that hate the grass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they cross the hither ridges and ride a stony bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adown to the dale of Thora, and the country of content;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the homes of a simple people, by cot and close they go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they come to Thora's dwelling; but fair it stands and low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst of orchard-closes, and round about men win<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair work in field and garden, and sweet are the sounds therein.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then down by the door leaps Gunnar, but awhile in the porch he stands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hearken the women's voices and the sound of their labouring hands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And amidst of their many murmurings a mightier voice he hears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The speech of his sister Gudrun: his inmost heart it stirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he entereth glad and smiling; bright, huge in the lowly hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stands in the beam of sunlight where the dust-motes dance and fall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On the high-seat sitteth Gudrun when she sees the man of war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come gleaming into the chamber; then she standeth up on the floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is great and goodly to look on mid the women of that place:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she knoweth the guise of the Niblungs, and she knoweth Gunnar's face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at first she turneth to flee, as erewhile she fled away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she rose from the wound of Sigurd and loathed the light of day:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span><span class="i0">But her father's heart rose in her, and the sleeping wrong awoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she made one step from the high-seat before Queen Thora's folk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Gunnar moved from the threshold, and smiled as he drew anear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hogni went behind him and the Mother of Kings was there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her maids and the Earls of the Niblungs stood gleaming there behind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, the kin and the friends of Gudrun, a smiling folk and kind!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the midst stood Gudrun before them, and cried aloud and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What! bear ye tidings of Sigurd? is he new come back from the dead?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O then will I hasten to greet him, and cherish my love and my lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the murderous sons of Giuki have borne the tale abroad."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dead-pale she stood before them, and no mouth answered again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the summer morn grew heavy, and chill were the hearts of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Thora's people trembled: there the simple people first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw the horror of the King-folk, and mighty lives accurst.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All hushed stood the glorious Gunnar, but Hogni came before,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now today do we come to this dwelling thy grief and thy woe to amend,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No man could say who beheld her if sorry or glad she were;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But her steady eyes are beholding the King and the Eastland's Fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she thinks: Have I lived too long? how swift doth the world grow worse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though it was but a little season that I slept, forgetting the curse!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the King speaks kingly unto her and they pass forth under the gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she sees he is rich and mighty, though the Niblung folk be great;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So strong is his house upbuilded, so many are his lords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So great the hosts for the murder and the meeting of the swords;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of the stubborn hearts of the Niblungs, and their hands that never yield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of their craving that nought fulfilleth, of their hosts arrayed for the field.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And say how fareth our sister mid the glory of her lord."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Knefrud looked upon Gunnar, and spake, nor sank his eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Each morn at the day's beginning when the sun hath hope to arise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She looketh from Atli's tower toward the west part and the grey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see the Niblung spear-heads gleam down the lonely way:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each eve at the day's departing on the topmost tower she stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looketh toward the mirk-wood and the sea of the western lands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There long in the wind she standeth, and the even grown acold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see the Niblung war-shields come forth from out the wold."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Gunnar turneth to Hogni, and he saith: "O glorious lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What saith thine heart to the bidding, and Atli's loving word?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I have done many deeds," said Hogni, "I have worn the smooth and the rough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the Gods looked on from heaven, and belike I have done enough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no deed for me abideth, but rather the sleep and the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou, O Son of King Giuki, art our eldest and our best,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By the wayside of the greedy doth many a peril lurk;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When the winds and the waves may be dealing with hate that hath far to come."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I hearken thy word," said Gunnar, "and I know in very deed<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span><span class="i0">Hear thou, O Eastland War-god, and bear this answer aback,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That nought may the earth of my people King Giuki's children lack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that here in the land am I biding till the Norns my life shall change;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howbeit, if here were Atli, his face were scarce more strange<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than that daughter of my father whom sore I long to see:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him come, and sit with the Niblungs, and be called their king with me."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then spake the guileful Knefrud, and his word was exceeding proud:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"It is little the wont of Atli to sit at meat with a crowd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet know, O Westland Warrior, that thy message shall be done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since the Cloudy Folk make ready new lodging for the sun."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He laughed, and the wise kept silence, and Gunnar heeded him nought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the daughter of his people was set the Niblung's thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sore he longed to behold her; for his life seemed wearing away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wealth and the fame he had gathered seemed nought by the earlier day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day of love departed, and of hope forgotten long.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Hogni laughs with the stranger, and cries out for harp and song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the glee rises up as a river when the mountain-tops grow clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When seaward drift the rain-clouds, and the end of day is near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of birds in the green groves singing is the Niblung manhood's voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Earls without foreboding in their mighty life rejoice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad then grows the King of the people, and the sweetness filleth his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he turneth about a little, and speaketh to Knefrud apart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What sayest thou, lord of the Eastland, how with Gudrun's heart it fares?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is she sunk in the day of dominion and the burden that it bears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or remembereth she her brethren and her father and her folk?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Knefrud looked upon Gunnar, and forth from the teeth he spoke:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"It is e'en as I said, King Gunnar: all eves she stands by the gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The coming of her kindred through the dusky tide to wait:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each day in the dawn she ariseth, and saith the time is at hand<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And she praiseth the waves of the ocean, how they toil and toil and blend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they break on the strand belov&egrave;d, and the Niblung earth in the end."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He spake, and the song rose upward and the wine of Kings was poured,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Gunnar heard in the wall-nook how the wind went forth abroad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he dreamed, and beheld the ocean, and all kingdoms of the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the world lay fair before him and his worship and his worth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then again spake the Eastland liar: "O King, I may not hide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That great things in the land of Atli thy mighty soul abide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the King is spent and war-weak, nor rejoiceth more in strife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his sons, the children of Gudrun, now look their first on life:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this end meseems is his bidding, that no worser men than ye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May sit in the throne of Atli and the place where he wont to be."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the tuneful hall of the Niblungs that Eastland liar spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he heard the song of the mighty o'er Gunnar's musing break,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his cold heart gladdened within him as man cried out to man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair 'twixt horn and beaker the red wine bubbled and ran.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last spake Gunnar the Niblung as his hand on the cup he laid:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A great king craveth our coming, and no more shall he be gainsayed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We will go to look on Atli, though the Gods and the Goths forbid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nought worse than death meseemeth on the Niblungs' path is hid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this shall the high Gods see to, but I to the Niblung name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the day of deeds to accomplish, and the gathering-in of fame."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Up he stood with the bowl in his right-hand, and mighty and great he was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he cried: "Now let the beakers adown the benches pass;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us drink dear draughts and glorious, though the last farewell it be,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span><span class="i0">And this draught that I drink have sundered my father's house and me."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He drank, and all men drank with him, and the hearts of the Earls arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of them that snatch forth glory from the deadly wall of foes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the joy of life were they drunken and no man knew for why,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the voice of their exultation rose up in an awful cry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;It is joy in the mouths that utter, it is hope in the hearts that crave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And think of no gainsaying, and remember nought to save;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But without the women hearken, and the hearts within them sink;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they say: What then betideth that our lords forbear to drink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wail and weep in the night-tide and cry the Gods to aid?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why then are the Kings tormented, and the warriors' hearts afraid?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the deadened sound sweeps landward, and the hearts of the field-folk fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they say: Is there death in the Burg, that thence goeth the cry and the wail?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, lo, the feast-hall's windows! blood-red through the dark they shine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why is weeping the song of the Niblungs, and blood the warrior's wine?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But therein are the torches tossing, and the shields of men upborne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the death-blades yet unbloodied cast up 'twixt bowl and horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all rest of heart is departed as men speak of the mirk-wood's ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fame of outland countries, and the green sea's troublous days.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Gunnar arose o'er the people, as a mighty King he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O ye of the house of Giuki that are joyous for my sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What then shall be left to the Niblungs if we return no more?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then let the wolves be warders of the Niblungs' gathered store!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the hearth let the worm creep over where the fire now flares aloft!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the adder coil in the chambers where the Niblung wives sleep soft!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let the master of the pine-wood roll huge in the Niblung porch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the moon through the broken rafters be the Niblungs' feastful torch!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Glad they cried on the glorious Gunnar; for they saw the love in his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span><span class="i0">And with joy and wine were they drunken, and his words passed over the wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As oft o'er the garden lilies goes the rising thunder-wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they know no other summer, and no spring that was they mind.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Hogni speaketh to Knefrud: "Lo, Gunnar's word is said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How fares it, lord, with Gudrun? remembereth she the dead?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the liar laughed out and answered: "Ye shall go tomorrow morn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man to turn back Gunnar shall never now be born:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each day-spring the white Gudrun on Sigurd's glory cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All eves she wails on Sigurd when the fair sun sinks and dies!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thou sayest sooth," said Hogni, "one day we twain shall wend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the gate of the Eastland Atli, that our tale may have an end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long time have I looked for the journey, and marvelled at the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With what eyes I shall look on Sigurd, what words his mouth shall say."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he raiseth the cup for Gunnar, and men see his glad face shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he crieth hail and glory o'er the bubbles of the wine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they drink to the lives of the brethren, and men of the latter earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May not think of the height of their hall-glee, or measure out their mirth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So they feast in the undark even to the midmost of the night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till at last, with sleep unwearied, they weary with delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pass forth to the beds blue-covered, and leave the hearth acold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sleep; in the hall grown silent scarce glimmereth now the gold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the moon from the world is departed, and grey clouds draw across,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hide the dawn's first promise and deepen earthly loss.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lone night draws to its death, and never another shall fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On those sons of the feastful warriors in the Niblungs' holy hall.<br /></span>

<h4>How the Niblungs fare to the Land of King Atli.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now when the house was silent, and all men in slumber lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet two hours were lacking of the dawning-tide of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sons of his foster-mother doth the heart-wise Hogni find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the dead night, speaking softly, he showeth them his mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they wake and hearken and heed him, and arise from the bolster blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor aught do their stout hearts falter at the deed he bids them do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he and they go softly while all men slumber and sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they enter the treasure-houses, and come to their midmost heap;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But so rich in the night it glimmers that the brethren hold their breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Hogni laugheth upon it:&mdash;long it lay on the Glittering Heath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long it lay in the house of Reidmar, long it lay 'neath the waters wan;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no long while hath it tarried in the houses and dwellings of man.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nor long these linger before it; they set their hands to the toil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And uplift the Bed of the Serpent, the Seed of murder and broil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No word they speak in their labour, but bear out load on load<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To great wains that out in the fore-court for the coming Gold abode:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most huge were the men, far mightier than the mightiest fashioned now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the salt sweat dimmed their eyesight and flooded cheek and brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere half the work was accomplished; and by then the laden wains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came groaning forth from the gateway, dawn drew on o'er the plains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the ramparts of the people, those walls high-built of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood grey as the bones of a battle in a dale few folk behold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in haste they goad the yoke-beasts, and press on and make no speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the hearts are proud within them and their eyes laugh each at each.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No great way down from the burg-gate, anigh to the hallowed field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lieth a lake in the river as round as Odin's shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A black pool huge and awful: ten long-ships of the most<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therein might wager battle, and the sunken should be lost<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span><span class="i0">Beyond all hope of diver, yea, beyond the plunging lead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On either side its rock-walls rise up to a mighty head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But by green slopes from the meadows 'tis easy drawing near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the brow whence the dark-grey rampart to the water goeth sheer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis as if the Niblung River had cleft the grave-mound through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the mightiest of all Giants ere the Gods' work was to do;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And indeed men well might deem it, that fearful sights lie hid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the unfathomed waters, the place to all forbid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No stream the black deep showeth, few winds may search its face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the silver-scaled sea-farers love nought its barren space.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There now the Niblung War-king and the foster-brethren twain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lead up their golden harvest and stay it wain by wain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they hang o'er the rim scarce balanced: no glance they cast below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the black and awful waters well known from long ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they cut the yoke-beasts' traces, and drive them down the slopes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who rush through the widening daylight, and bellow forth their hopes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the straw-stall and the barley: but the Niblungs turn once more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hard toil the warrior cart-carles for the garnering of their store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shoulder on the wain-wheels o'er the edge of the grimly wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stand upright to behold it, how the waggons plunge and fall.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Down then and whirling outward the ruddy Gold fell forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a flame in the dim grey morning, flashed out a kingdom's worth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the waters, roared above it, the wan water and the foam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flew up o'er the face of the rock-wall as the tinkling Gold fell home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unheard, unseen for ever, a wonder and a tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the last of earthly singers from, the sons of men shall fail:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the face of the further waters a widening ripple rent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forth from hollow places strange sounds as of talking went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loud laughed Hogni in answer; but not so long he stayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As that half the oily ripple in long sleepy coils was laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the lapping fallen silent in the water-beaten caves;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span><span class="i0">Scarce streamward yet were drifting the foam-heaps o'er the waves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When betwixt the foster-brethren down the slopes King Hogni strode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward the ancient Burg of his fathers, as a man that casteth a load:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No word those fellows had spoken since he whispered low and light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the beds of the foster-brethren in the dead hour of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his face was proud and glorious as he strode the war-gate through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And went up to his kingly chamber, and the golden bed he knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lay down and slept by his help-mate as a play-spent child might sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In some franklin's wealthy homestead, in the room the nurses keep.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nought the sun on that morn delayeth, but light o'er the world's face flies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And awake by the side of King Hogni the wedded woman lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her bosom is weary with sighing, and her eyes with dream-born tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a sound as of all confusion is ever in her ears:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then she turneth and crieth to Hogni, as she layeth a hand on his breast;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With evil will I meet evil when it draweth exceeding near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oft have I heard of evil, whose father was but fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his mother lust of living, and nought will I deal with it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest the past, and those deeds of my doing be as straw when the fire is lit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo now, O Daughter of Kings, let us rise in the face of the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be glad in the summer morning when the kindred ride on their way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For tears beseem not king-folk, nor a heart made dull with dreams,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There the talk falls down between them, and they rise in the morn, they twain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Meanwhile awakeneth Gunnar, and looks on the wife by his side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saith: "Why weepest thou, Glaumvor, what evil now shall betide?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She said: "I was waking and dreamed, or I slept and saw the truth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Norns are hooded and angry, and the Gods have forgotten their ruth."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Speak, sweet-mouthed woman," said Gunnar, "if the Norns are hard, I am kind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though even the King of the Niblungs may loose not where they bind."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She said: "Wilt thou go unto Atli and enter the Burg of the East?<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span><span class="i0">Wilt thou leave the house of the faithful, and turn to the murderer's feast?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It is e'en as certain," said Gunnar, "as though I knocked at his gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the winds and waters stay not, or death, or the dealings of Fate."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Woe worth the while!" said Glaumvor, "then I talk with the dead indeed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why must I tarry behind thee afar from the Niblungs' Need?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He said: "Thou wert heavy-hearted last night for the parting-tide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And alone in the dreamy country thy soul would needs abide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see not the King that loves thee, nor remember the might of his hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So thou falledst a prey unholpen to the lies of the dreamy land."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah, would they were lies," said Glaumvor, "for not the worst was this:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There thou wert in the holy high-seat mid the heart of the Niblung bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a sword was borne into our midmost, and its point and its edge were red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at either end the wood-wolves howled out in the day of dread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that sword wert thou smitten, O Gunnar, and the sharp point pierced thee through.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the kin were all departed, and no face of man I knew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I strove to flee and might not; for day grew dark and strange,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no moonrise and no morning the eyeless mirk would change."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Such are dreams of the night," said Gunnar, "that lovers oft perplex,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the sundering hour is coming with the cares that entangle and vex.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet if there be more, fair woman, when a king speaks loving words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May I cast back words of anger, and the threat of grinded swords?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O yet wouldst thou tarry," said Glaumvor, "in the fair sun-lighted day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor give thy wife to another, nor cast thy kingdom away."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of what king of the people," said Gunnar, "hast thou known it written or told,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Alas, alas!" said Glaumvor, "then all is over and done!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I dreamed of the hall of the Niblungs at the setting of the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How dead women came in thither no worse than queens arrayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who passed by the earls of the Niblungs, and their hands on thy gown-skirt laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hailed thee fair for their fellow, and bade thee come to their hall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O bethink thee, King of the Niblungs, what tidings shall befall!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yea, shall they befall?" said Gunnar, "then who am I to strive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the change of my life-days, while the Gods on high are alive?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall ride as my heart would have me; let the Gods bestir them then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raise up another people in the stead of the Niblung men:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But at home shalt thou sit, King's Daughter, in the keeping of the Fates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be blithe with the men of thy people and the guest within thy gates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till thou know of our glad returning to the holy house and dear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the fall of Giuki's children, and a tale that all shall hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arise and do on gladness, lest the clouds roll on and lower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the heavy hearts of the people in the Niblungs' parting hour."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he spake, and his love rejoiced her, and they rose in the face of the day,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thus stirreth the house of the Niblungs, and awakeneth unto life;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The last-learned craft of battle to their fathers ere they go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is mocking and mirth and laughter as men tell to the ancient sires<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lo now, a stir by the doorway, and men see how great and grand<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They go forth fair and softly as they wend to the seat of the Kings,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Are they not as the children of Giuki, that fared afield erewhile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hope without contention, mid the youth that knew no guile?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their wedded wives are beside them with faces proud and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That smile, if the lips smile only, for the Eastland liar is there.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But Hogni spake to his brother, and they looked on the liar's son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clear ran King Gunnar's laughter as the summer waters run;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the Queens' hearts fainted within them, and with pain they drew their breath;<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Three days the Niblung warriors the ways of the mirk-wood ride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they come to a land of cities and the peopled country-side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the land's-folk run from their labour, and the merchants throng the street<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lords of many a city the stranger kings would meet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nought will the Niblungs tarry; swift through Atli's weal they wend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For their hearts are exceeding eager for their journey's latter end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three days they ride that country, and many a city leave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the fourth dawn mighty mountains by the inner sea upheave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they ride a little further, and Atli's burg they see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the feet of the mountains mingled above the flowery lea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet a little further, and lo, its long white wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its high-built guarded gateways, and its towers o'erhung and tall;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then they look to the right and the left hand, and see no folk astir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no reek from the homestead chimneys; and no toil of men they hear:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The bucket thirsts by the well-side, the void cart cumbers the way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then doubt on the war-host falleth, and they think: Well were we then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When once we rode in the Westland and saw the brown-faced men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peer through the hawthorn hedges as the Niblung host went by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet they laugh and make no semblance of any fear drawn nigh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, Knefrud looked upon them, and with chilly voice he spake:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now his guests doth Atli honour, and yet more will he do for your sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hath hidden all his people, and holdeth his vassals at home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the day that the mighty Niblungs adown his highway come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest men fear as the finders of Gods, and tremble and cumber the ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the voice of the singers fail them to sing of the Niblungs' praise."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Men laughed as his voice they hearkened, and none bade turn again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the swords in the scabbards rattled as they rode with loosened rein.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now they ride in the Burg-gate's shadow from out the sunlit fields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the spears aloft are hidden and Atli's painted shields;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no captain cries from the rampart, nor soundeth any horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the doors of oak and iron are shut this merry morn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the Niblungs leap from the saddle, and the threats of earls arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wrath of Kings' defenders is waxing in their eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Knefrud looketh and laugheth, and he saith:<br /></span>
<span class="i18">"So is Atli fain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the glory of the Niblungs and their honour's utmost gain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By no feet but yours this morning will he have his threshold trod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, not by the world's most glorious, nay not by a wandering God."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then Hogni looked on Knefrud as the bodily death shall gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the last of the Kings of men-folk in the last of the latter days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he caught a staff from his saddle, a mighty axe of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood most huge of all men in face of Atli's door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And upreared the axe against it with such wondrous strokes and great,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the iron-knitted marvel hung shattered in the gate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the rent poured the Niblung children, and in Atli's burg they stood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With none to bid them welcome, or ask them what they would.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Hogni turned upon Knefrud, and spake: "I said, time was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we twain should ride out hither to bring a deed to pass:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now one more deed abideth, and then no more for thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And another and another, and no more deeds for me."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Gainst the liar's eyes one moment flashed out the axe-head's sheen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then was the face of Knefrud as though it ne'er had been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his gay-clad corpse lay glittering on the causeway in the sun.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No man cried out on Hogni or asked of the deed so done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But their shielded ranks they marshalled and through Atli's burg they strode:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There they see the merchant's dwelling, the rich man's fair abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The halls of doom, and the market, the loom and the smithying-booth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stall for the wares of the outlands, the temples high and smooth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all is hushed and empty, and no child of man they meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they thread the city's tangle, and enter street on street,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave the last forgotten, and of the next know nought.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So through the silent city by the Norns their feet are brought,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And a hall with gates all brazen, and roof of ruddy gold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they know the house of Atli, and they trow that sooth it is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the Lord of such a dwelling may give his guest-folk bliss:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they loosen the swords in their scabbards, and upraise a mighty shout,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the brazen doors swing open: but the Niblungs are at the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bidden guests of Atli o'er the fateful threshold pour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the music faileth before them, till its sound is over and done,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No man of the Niblungs murmureth, none biddeth turn aback<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No King and no earl-folk's children do the bidden guests behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till they look aloft to the high-seat, and lo, a woman alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A white queen crowned, and silent as the ancient shapen stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That men find in the dale deserted, as beneath the moon they wend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they weary even to slumber, and the journey draws to an end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chill then are the hearts of the warriors, for they know how they look on a queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Gudrun well-belov&egrave;d of the days that once have been;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then were men that murmured on Sigurd, and as in some dream of the night<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But forth stood the mighty Gunnar, and men heard his kingly voice<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As she spake the outer door-leaves clashed to with a mighty sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the outer air was troubled with a new noise gathering around:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As of leaves in the midmost summer ere the dusk of the even warm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the winds in the hillsides gathered go forth before the storm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men abode, and a wicket opened on the feast-hall's inner side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Niblungs looked for the coming of King Atli in his pride:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one man entered only, and he thin and old and spare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A swordless man and a little&mdash;yet was King Atli there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He looked not once on the Niblungs, but forth to the high-seat went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood aloof from Gudrun with his eyes to the hall-floor bent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence came a voice from his lips, and men heard, for the hush was great.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hearts of the bold were astonished 'neath the overhanging fate.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ye are come, O Kings of the Niblungs, ye are come, O slayers of men!<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then spake the wise-heart Hogni: "Do the bidden guests so long<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Till thou and the great feast-master shall bid the best befall."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There were cries of men in the city, there was clang and clatter of steel.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yea, all the world it might be, and all sounds of the earth were stilled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that cry of the name of Atli: but Gunnar stood for a space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the cry was something sunken, then he put back the helm from his face<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span><span class="i0">And spread out his hands before him, and his hands were empty and bare<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We shall live and never be little, we shall die and be masters of fame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not thy will, O Atli, nor what thou wouldst with thy name."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ye shall know my will," said Atli, "ye shall do it, or do no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deeds of the days of the living: ye shall render the garnered store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye shall give forth the Gold of Sigurd, the wealth of the uttermost strand."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To give a gift," cried Hogni, "we came to King Atli's land:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of all kings ever told of; and the rest let the high Gods rule."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O King of the East," said Gunnar, "great gifts for thee draw nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the treasure of the Niblungs in their guarded house shall lie."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What then will ye do?" quoth Atli; "have ye seen the fish in the net?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Eve telleth of deeds," said Gunnar, "and it is but the morning as yet."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said Atli: "Yea, will ye die? are there no deeds left you to do?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We shall smite with the sword," said the Niblung, "and tomorn will we journey anew."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Craftsmaster Hogni," said Atli, "where then are the shifts of the wise?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said Hogni: "To smite with the sword, and go glad from the country of lies."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So died the fool," said Atli, "as Hogni dieth today."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Smote the blind and the aimless," said Hogni, "and Baldur passed away."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said Atli: "Yet may ye live in the wholesome light of the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And your latter days be as plenteous as the deeds your hands have done."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Dost thou hearken, O sword," said Gunnar, "and yet thou liest in peace?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When then wilt thou look on the daylight, that the words of the mocker may cease?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thou, Hogni the wise," said Atli, "art thou weary of wisdom and lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou die with these fools of the sword, and be mocked mid the blind of the war?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Many things have I learned," said Hogni, "but today's task, easy it is;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For men die every hour and they wage no master for this.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Get hence, thou evil King, thou liar and traitor of kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest the edge of my sword be thy portion and not the ruddy rings!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Atli shrank from before him, and the eyes of his intent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no more words he cast them, but forth from the hall he went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And again were the Niblung children alone in the hall of their foes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the wan and silent woman: but without great clamour arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the clashing of steel against steel, and the crying of man unto man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wind of that summer morning through the Eastland banners ran:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then so loud o'er all was winded a mighty horn of fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That unheard were the shouts of the Niblungs as Gunnar's sword leapt white.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Hogni turned to the great-one who the Niblung trumpet bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he took the mighty metal, and kissed the brass of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its shattering blast went forward, and beat back from the gable-wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shook the ancient timbers, and the carven work of the hall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then it was to the Niblung warriors as their very hearts they heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cry out, not glad nor sorry, nor hoping, nor afeard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But touched by the hand of Odin, smit with foretaste of the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the fire shall burn up fooling, and the veil shall fall away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When bare-faced, all unmingled, shall the evil stand in the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men's deeds shall be nothing doubtful, nor the foe that they shall smite.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span><span class="i0">In the hall was the voice of the trumpet, but therein might it nowise abide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But over burg and lealand it spread full far and wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strong men quaked as they heard it in the guarded chamber of stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the lord of weaponed kinsfolk was as one that sitteth alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a land by the foeman wasted, and no man to his neighbour spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they thought on the death of Atli and the slaughter of the folk.<br /></span>

<h4>Of the Battle in Atli's Hall.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ye shall know that in Atli's feast-hall on the side that joined the house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were many carven doorways whose work was glorious<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With marble stones and gold-work, and their doors of beaten brass:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo now, in the merry morning how the story cometh to pass!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;While the echoes of the trumpet yet fill the people's ears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hogni casts by the war-horn, and his Dwarf-wrought sword uprears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All those doors aforesaid open, and in pour the streams of steel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The best of the Eastland champions, the bold men of Atli's weal:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They raise no cry of battle nor cast forth threat of woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their helmed and hidden faces from each other none may know:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a light in the hall ariseth, and the fire of battle runs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All adown the front of the Niblungs in the face of the mighty-ones;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All eyes are set upon them, hard drawn is every breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere the foremost points be mingled and death be blent with death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;All eyes save the eyes of Hogni; but e'en as the edges meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He turneth about for a moment to the gold of the kingly seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then aback to the front of battle; there then, as the lightning-flash<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the dark night showeth the city when the clouds of heaven clash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the gazer shrinketh backward, yet he seeth from end to end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The street and the merry market, and the windows of his friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pavement where his footsteps yestre'en returning trod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now white and changed and dreadful 'neath the threatening voice of God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Hogni seeth Gudrun, and the face he used to know,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span><span class="i0">Unspeakable, unchanging, with white unknitted brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With half-closed lips untrembling, with deedless hands and cold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid still on knees that stir not, and the linen's moveless fold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Turned Hogni unto the spear-wall, and smote from where he stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hewed with his sword two-handed as the axe-man in a wood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before his sword was a champion and the edges clave to the chin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the first man fell in the feast-hall of those that should fall therein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then man with man was dealing, and the Niblung host of war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was swept by the leaping iron, as the rock anigh the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the ice-cold waves of winter: yet a moment Gunnar stayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As high in his hand unbloodied he shook his awful blade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i6">"O Eastland champions, do ye behold it here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sword of the ancient Giuki? Fall on and have no fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But slay and be slain and be famous, if your master's will it be!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet are we the blameless Niblungs, and bidden guests are we:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So forbear, if ye wander hood-winked, nor for nothing slay and be slain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I know not what to tell you of the dead that live again."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he saith in the midst of the foemen with his war-flame reared on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all about and around him goes up a bitter cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the iron men of Atli, and the bickering of the steel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sends a roar up to the roof-ridge, and the Niblung war-ranks reel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind the steadfast Gunnar: but lo, have ye seen the corn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While yet men grind the sickle, by the wind-streak overborne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the sudden rain sweeps downward, and summer groweth black,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the smitten wood-side roareth 'neath the driving thunder-wrack?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So before the wise-heart Hogni shrank the champions of the East<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As his great voice shook the timbers in the hall of Atli's feast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There he smote and beheld not the smitten, and by nought were his edges stopped;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He smote and the dead were thrust from him; a hand with its shield he lopped;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There met him Atli's marshal, and his arm at the shoulder he shred;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span><span class="i0">Three swords were upreared against him of the best of the kin of the dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he struck off a head to the rightward, and his sword through a throat he thrust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the third stroke fell on his helm-crest, and he stooped to the ruddy dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And uprose as the ancient Giant, and both his hands were wet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red then was the world to his eyen, as his hand to the labour he set;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swords shook and fell in his pathway, huge bodies leapt and fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harsh grided shield and war-helm like the tempest-smitten bell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the war-cries ran together, and no man his brother knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dead men loaded the living, as he went the war-wood through;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And man 'gainst man was huddled, till no sword rose to smite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clear stood the glorious Hogni in an island of the fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there ran a river of death 'twixt the Niblung and his foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefrom the terror of men and the wrath of the Gods arose.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now fell the sword of Gunnar and rose up red in the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hearkened the song of the Niblung, as his voice rang glad and clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rejoiced and leapt at the Eastmen, and cried as it met the rings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a giant of King Atli, and a murder-wolf of kings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it quenched its thirst in his entrails, and knew the heart in his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hearkened the praise of Gunnar, and lingered not to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fell upon Atli's brother and stayed not in his brain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he fell and the King leapt over, and clave a neck atwain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leapt o'er the sweep of a pole-axe and thrust a lord in the throat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And King Atli's banner-bearer through shield and hauberk smote;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he laughed on the huddled East-folk, and against their war-shields drave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the white swords tossed about him, and that archer's skull he clave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Atli had bought in the Southlands for many a pound of gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dark-skinned fell upon Gunnar and over his war-shield rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cumbered his sword for a season, and the many blades fell on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sheared the cloudy helm-crest and rents in his hauberk won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the red blood ran from Gunnar; till that Giuki's sword outburst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the fire-tongue from the smoulder that the leafy heap hath nursed,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span><span class="i0">And unshielded smote King Gunnar, and sent the Niblung song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the quaking stems of battle in the hall of Atli's wrong:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he rent the knitted war-hedge till by Hogni's side he stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kissed him amidst of the spear-hail, and their cheeks were wet with blood.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then on came the Niblung bucklers, and they drave the East-folk home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the bows of the oar-driven long-ship beat off the waves in foam:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They leave their dead behind them, and they come to the doors and the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a few last spears from the fleeing amidst their shield-hedge fall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the doors clash to in their faces, as the fleeing rout they drive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fain would follow after; and none is left alive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the feast-hall of King Atli, save those fishes of the net,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the white and silent woman above the slaughter set.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then biddeth the heart-wise Hogni, and men to the windows climb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And uplift the war-grey corpses, dead drift of the stormy time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cast them adown to their people: thence they come aback and say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That scarce shall ye see the houses, and no whit the wheel-worn way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the spears and shields of the Eastlands that the merchant city throng:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And back to the Niblung burg-gate the way seemed weary-long.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet passeth hour on hour, and the doors they watch and ward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a long while hear no mail-clash, nor the ringing of the sword;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then droop the Niblung children, and their wounds are waxen chill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they think of the Burg by the river, and the builded holy hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their eyes are set on Gudrun as of men who would beseech;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But unlearned are they in craving and know not dastard's speech.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then doth Giuki's first-begotten a deed most fair to be told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his fair harp Gunnar taketh, and the warp of silver and gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the hand of a cunning harper he dealeth with the strings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his voice in their midst goeth upward, as of ancient days he sings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the days before the Niblungs, and the days that shall be yet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the hour of toil and smiting the warrior hearts forget,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span><span class="i0">Nor hear the gathering foemen, nor the sound of swords aloof:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then clear the song of Gunnar goes up to the dusky roof;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the coming spear-host tarries, and the bearers of the woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the cloisters of King Atli with lingering footsteps go.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Hogni looketh on Gudrun, and no change in her face he sees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no stir in her folded linen and the deedless hands on her knees:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from Gunnar's side he hasteneth; and lo, the open door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a foeman treadeth the pavement, and his lips are on Atli's floor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Hogni is death in the doorway: then the Niblungs turn on the foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hosts are mingled together, and blow cries out on blow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still the song goeth up from Gunnar, though his harp to earth be laid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he fighteth exceeding wisely, and is many a warrior's aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he shieldeth and delivereth, and his eyes search through the hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And woe is he for his fellows, as his battle-brethren fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the turmoil hideth little from that glorious folk-king's eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er all he beholdeth Gudrun, and his soul is waxen wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he saith: We shall look on Sigurd, and Sigmund of old days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see the boughs of the Branstock o'er the ancient Volsung's praise.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Woe's me for the wrath of Hogni! From the door he giveth aback<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the Eastland slayers may enter to the murder and the wrack:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he rageth and driveth the battle to the golden kingly seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the last of the foes he slayeth by Gudrun's very feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the red blood splasheth her raiment; and his own blood therewithal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He casteth aloft before her, and the drops on her white hands fall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But nought she seeth or heedeth, and again he turns to the fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor heedeth stroke nor wounding so he a foe may smite:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the battle opens before him, and the Niblungs draw to his side;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Death in the world first fashioned, through the feast-hall doth he stride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so once more do the Niblungs sweep that murder-flood of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the hall of toils and treason, and the doors swing to again.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then again is there peace for a little within the fateful fold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the Niblungs look about them, and but few folk they behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upright on their feet for the battle: now they climb aloft no more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor cast the dead from the windows; but they raise a rampart of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its stones are the fallen East-folk, and no lowly wall is that.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Therein was Gunnar the mighty: on the shields of men he sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sons of his people hearkened, for his hand through the harp-strings ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he sang in the hall of his foeman of the Gods and the making of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how season was sundered from season in the days of the fashioning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And became the Summer and Autumn, and became the Winter and Spring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sang of men's hunger and labour, and their love and their breeding of broil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their hope that is fostered of famine, and their rest that is fashioned of toil:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fame then and the sword he sang of, and the hour of the hardy and wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the last of the living shall perish, and the first of the dead shall arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the torch shall be lit in the daylight, and God unto man shall pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the heart shall cry out for the hand in the fight of the uttermost day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he sang, and beheld not Gudrun, save as long ago he saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sister, the little maiden of the face without a flaw:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wearily Hogni beheld her, and no change in her face there was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long thereon gazed Hogni, and set his brows as the brass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the hands of the King were weary, and weak his knees were grown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he felt as a man unholpen in a waste land wending alone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the noon was long passed over when again the rumour arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the doors cast open flowed in the river of foes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They flooded the hall of the murder, and surged round that rampart of dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No war-duke ran before them, no lord to the onset led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the thralls shot spears at adventure, and shot out shafts from afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the misty hall was blinded with the bitter drift of war:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Few and faint were the Niblung children, and their wounds were waxen acold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they saw the Hell-gates open as they stood in their grimly hold:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet thrice stormed out King Hogni, thrice stormed out Gunnar the King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice fell they aback yet living to the heart of the fated ring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they looked and their band was little, and no man but was wounded sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hall seemed growing greater, such hosts of foes it bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So tossed the iron harvest from wall to gilded wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they looked and the white-clad Gudrun sat silent over all.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the churls and thralls of the Eastland howled out as wolves accurst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oft gaped the Niblungs voiceless, for they choked with anger and thirst;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the hall grew hot as a furnace, and men drank their flowing blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men laughed and gnawed on their shield-rims, men knew not where they stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw not what was before them; as in the dark men smote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men died heart-broken, unsmitten; men wept with the cry in the throat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men lived on full of war-shafts, men cast their shields aside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And caught the spears to their bosoms; men rushed with none beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fell unarmed on the foemen, and tore and slew in death:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still down rained the arrows as the rain across the heath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still proud o'er all the turmoil stood the Kings of Giuki born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor knit were the brows of Gunnar, nor his song-speech overworn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Hogni's mouth kept silence, and oft his heart went forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the long, long day of the darkness, and the end of worldly worth.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Loud rose the roar of the East-folk, and the end was coming at last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now the foremost locked their shield-rims and the hindmost over them cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nigher they drew and nigher, and their fear was fading away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For every man of the Niblungs on the shaft-strewn pavement lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save Gunnar the King and Hogni: still the glorious King up-bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cloudy shield of the Niblungs set full of shafts of war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Hogni's hands had fainted, and his shield had sunk adown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So thick with the Eastland spearwood was that rampart of renown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hacked and dull were the edges that had rent the wall of foes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he stood upright by Gunnar before that shielded close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor looked on the foemen's faces as their wild eyes drew anear,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span><span class="i0">And their faltering shield-rims clattered with the remnant of their fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he gazed on the Niblung woman, and the daughter of his folk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sat o'er all unchanging ere the war-cloud over them broke.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now nothing might men hearken in the house of Atli's weal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save the feet slow tramping onward, and the rattling of the steel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the song of the glorious Gunnar, that rang as clearly now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the speckled storm-cock singeth from the scant-leaved hawthorn-bough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the sun is dusking over and the March snow pelts the land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There stood the mighty Gunnar with sword and shield in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There stood the shieldless Hogni with set unangry eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watched the wall of war-shields o'er the dead men's rampart rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the white blades flickering nigher, and the quavering points of war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the heavy air of the feast-hall was rent with a fearful roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the turmoil came and the tangle, as the wall together ran:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But aloft yet towered the Niblungs, and man toppled over man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leapt and struggled to tear them; as whiles amidst the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The doomed ship strives its utmost with mid-ocean's mastery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tall masts whip the cordage, while the welter whirls and leaps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they rise and reel and waver, and sink amid the deeps:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So before the little-hearted in King Atli's murder-hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did the glorious sons of Giuki 'neath the shielded onrush fall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sore wounded, bound and helpless, but living yet, they lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the afternoon and the even in the first of night shall die.<br /></span>

<h4>Of the Slaying of the Niblung Kings.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lo now, 'tis an hour or twain, and a labour lightly won<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the serving-men of Atli, and the Niblung blood is gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the golden house of his greatness, and the Eastland dead no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lie in great heaps together on Atli's mazy floor:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they cast fair summer blossoms o'er the footprints of the dead,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span><span class="i0">They wreathe round Atli's high-seat and the benches fair bespread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they light the odorous torches, and the sun of the golden roof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the candles of King Atli hold dusky night aloof.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they toil and are heavy-hearted, nor know what next shall betide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they look on the stranger-woman in the heart of Atli's pride.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now stand they aback for the trumpet and the merry minstrelsy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they tremble before King Atli, and golden-clad is he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his golden crown is heavy and he strides exceeding slow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the wise and the mighty about him, through the house of the Niblungs' woe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There then by the Niblung woman on the throne he sat him down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And folk heard the gold gear tinkle and the rings of the Eastland crown:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Folk looked on his rich adornment, on King Atli's pride they gazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bright beams wearied their eyen, by the glory were they dazed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the councillors kept silence and the warriors clad in steel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All men lowly, all men mighty, that had care of Atli's weal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea there in the hall were they waiting for the word to come from his lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they of the merchant-city behold the shield-hung ships<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweep slow through the windless haven with their gaping heads of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they know not their nation and names, nor hath aught of their errand been told.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But King Atli looketh before him, and is grown too great to rejoice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he speaks and the world is troubled, though thin and scant be his voice:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bring forth the fallen and conquered, bring forth the bounden thrall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they who were once the Niblungs did once King Hogni call."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they brought him fettered and bound; and scarce on his feet he stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But men stayed him up by the King; for the sword had drunk of his blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the might of his body had failed him, and yet so great was he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the East-folk cowered before him and the might of his majesty.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then spake the all-great Atli: "Thou yielded thrall of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would hear thee tell of the Treasure, the Hoard of the kings of yore!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But words were grown heavy to Hogni, and scarce he spake with a smile:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Let the living seek their desire; for indeed thou shalt live for a while."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wilt thou speak and live," said Atli, "nor pay for the blood thou hast spilt?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said he: "Thou art waxen so mighty, thou mayst have the Gold when thou wilt."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said the King: "I will give thee thy life, and forgive thee measureless woe."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It was gathered for thee," said Hogni, "and fashioned long ago."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Speak, man o'ercome," quoth Atli: "Is life so little a thing?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Art thou mighty? put forth thine hand and gather the Gold!" said the King.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wilt thou tell of the Gold," said the East-King, "the desire of many eyes?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yea, once on a day," said Hogni, "when the dead from the sea shall arise."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said he: "So great is my longing, that, O foe, I would have thee live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, live and be great as aforetime, if this word thou yet wouldst give."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said the Niblung: "Thee shall I heed, or the longing of thy pride?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, who heeded Sigurd nothing, who thrust mine oath aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the years were young and goodly and the summer bore increase!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I crave my life of the greedy and pray for days of peace?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, who whetted the sword for Sigurd, and bared the blade in the morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smote ere the sun's uprising, and left my sister forlorn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Yea I lied,' quoth the God-loved Singer, 'when the will of the Gods I told!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Stretch forth thine hand, O Mighty, and take thy Treasure of Gold!"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then was Atli silent a little, for anger dulled his thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the heaped-up wealth of the Eastland seemed an idle thing and nought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He turned and looked upon Gudrun as one who was fain to beseech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he saw her eyes that beheld not, and her lips that knew no speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fear shot across his anger, and guile with his wrath was blent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he spake aloud to the war-lords:<br /></span>
<span class="i14">"O ye, shall the eve be spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor behold the East rejoicing? what a mock for the Gods is this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That men ever care for the morrow, nor nurse their toil-won bliss!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo now, this hour I speak in is the first of the seven-days' feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the spring of our exultation o'er the glory of the East:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draw nigh, O wise, O mighty, and gather words to praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hope of the King accomplished in the harvest of his days:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bear forth this slave of the Niblungs to the pit and the chamber of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he hearken the council of night, and the rede that tomorrow saith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And think of the might of King Atli, and his hand that taketh his own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the hill-fox bark at his going, and his path with the bramble be grown."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they led the Niblung away from the light and the joy of the feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the chamber of death they cast him, and the pit of the Lord of the East:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thralls were the high King's warders; yet sons of the wise withal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came down to sit with Hogni in the doomed man's darkling hall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they looked in his face and feared, lest Atli smite too nigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kin of the Gods of Heaven, and more than a man's child die.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But 'neath the golden roof-sun, at beginning of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the seven-days' feast of triumph in the hall of Atli dight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his living Earls come thither in peaceful gold attire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cups on the East-King's tables shine out as a river of fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet is the song of the harp-strings, and the singers' honeyed words;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While wide through all the city do wives bewail their lords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And curse the untimely hour and the day of the land forlorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the year that the Earth shall rue of, and children never born.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Atli spake to his thrall-folk, and they went, and were little afraid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take the glorious Gunnar, and the King in shackles laid:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They deemed they should live for ever, and eat and sleep as the swine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To them were the tales of the singers no token and no sign;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the blossom of the Niblungs they rolled amid the dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That well-renown&egrave;d Gunnar 'neath Atli's chair they thrust;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The feet of the Eastland liar on Gunnar's neck are set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by Atli Gudrun sitteth, and nought she stirreth yet.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Outbrake the glee of the dastards, and they that had not dared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet the swords of the Niblungs, no whit the God-folk feared:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They forgat that the Norns were awake, and they praised the master of guile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The war-spent conquering Atli and the face without a smile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tumult of their triumph and the wordless mingled roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went forth from that hall of the Eastlands and smote the heavenly floor.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At last spake Atli the mighty: "Stand up, thou war-won thrall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom they that were once the Niblungs did once King Gunnar call!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From the dust they dragged up Gunnar, and set him on his feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the heart within him was living and the pride for a war-king meet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his glory was nothing abated, and fair he seemed and young,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the first of the Cloudy Kings, fresh shoot from the sower sprung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Atli looked upon him, and a smile smoothed out his brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he said: "What thoughtest thou, Gunnar, when thou layst in the dust e'en now?"<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yet words of mine shalt thou hearken," said Atli, "or ever thou die."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So crieth the fool," said Gunnar, "on the God that his folly hath slain."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">With a dreadful voice cried Gunnar: "O fool, hast thou heard it told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who won the Treasure aforetime and the ruddy rings of the Gold?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was Sigurd, child of the Volsungs, the best sprung forth from the best:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rode from the North and the mountains and became my summer-guest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My friend and my brother sworn: he rode the Wavering Fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And won me the Queen of Glory and accomplished my desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The praise of the world he was, the hope of the biders in wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The help of the lowly people, the hammer of the strong:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, oft in the world henceforward shall the tale be told of the deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, e'en I, will tell it in the day of the Niblungs' Need:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I sat night-long in my armour, and when light was wide o'er the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I slaughtered Sigurd my brother, and looked on the work of mine hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, O mighty Atli, I have seen the Niblungs' wreck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the feet of the faint-heart dastard have trodden Gunnar's neck;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if all be little enough, and the Gods begrudge me rest,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span><span class="i0">Let me see the heart of Hogni cut quick from his living breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laid, on the dish before me: and then shall I tell of the Gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And become thy servant, Atli, and my life at thy pleasure hold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O goodly story of Gunnar, and the King of the broken troth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the heavy Need of the Niblungs, and the Sorrow of Odin the Goth!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Grim then waxed Atli bemocked, yet he pondered a little while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For yet with his bitter anger strove the hope of his greedy guile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as one who falleth a-dreaming he hearkened Gunnar's word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While his eyes beheld that Treasure, and the rings of the Ancient Hoard.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But he spake low-voiced to his sword-carles, and they heard and understood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And departed swift from the feast-hall to do the work he would.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the chamber of death they gat them, to the pit they went adown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw the wise men sitting round the war-king of renown:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they spake: "We are Atli's bondmen, and Atli's doom we bring:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We shall carve the heart from thy body, and thou living yet, O King."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Hogni laughed, for they feared him; and he said: "Speed ye the work!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fain would I look on the storehouse where such marvels used to lurk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the forge of fond desires, and the nurse of life that fails.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take heed now! deeds are doing for the fashioners of tales."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But they feared as they looked on the Niblung, and the wise men hearkened and spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade them abide for a season, yea even for Atli's sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the night-slaying is as the murder; and they looked on each other and feared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Atli's bitter whisper their very hearts had heard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they said: "The King makes merry, as a well the white wine springs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the red wine runs as a river; and what are the hearts of kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That men may know them naked from the hearts of bond and thrall?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor go we empty-handed to King Atli in his hall."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the sword-carles spake to each other, and they looked and a man they saw,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A thrall-born servant of servants, begetter of thralls on the earth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they said: "If this one were away, scarce greater were waxen the dearth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That this morning hath wrought on the Eastland; for the years shall eke out his woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no day his toil shall lessen, and worse and worse shall he grow."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They drew the steel new-whetted, on the thrall they laid the hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they said: "All hearts be fashioned as the heart of the King of the land."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the thrall was bewildered with anguish, and wept and bewailed him sore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the loss of his life of labour, and the grief that long he bore.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But wroth was the son of Giuki and he spake: "It is idle and vain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">It is better to die than be sorry, and to hear the trembling cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to see the shame of the poor: O fools, must the lowly die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because kings strove with swords? I bid you to hasten the end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For my soul is sick with confusion, and fain on the way would I wend."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the life of the thrall is over, and his fearful heart they set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a fair wide golden platter, and bear it ruddy wet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the throne of the triumphing East-King; he looketh, and feareth withal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest the house should fail about him and the golden roof should fall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Gunnar laughed beside him, and spake o'er the laden gold:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O heart of a feeble trembler, no heart of Hogni the bold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gold dish bears thee quaking, yet indeed thou quakedst more<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The great hall was smitten silent and its mirth to fear was turned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the wrath of the King was kindled, and the eyes of Atli burned,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Fear ye to mock King Atli till his head in the dust be alow!"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the sword-carles flee before him, and are angry with their dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they fear the living East-King yet more than the Niblung dead:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They come to the pit and the death-house, and the whetted steel they bear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are pale before King Hogni; as winter-wolves they glare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom the ravening hunger driveth, when the chapmen journey slow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their horses faint in the moon-dusk, and stumble through the snow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Hogni laughed before them, and he saith: "Now welcome again,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I looked that ye should be speedy; and, forsooth, ye needs must haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest more lives than one this even for Atli's will ye waste."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">About him throng the sword-men, and they shout as the war-fain cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the heart of the bitter battle when their hour is come to die,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With the bound man swift is the steel: sore tremble the sons of the wise,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For the mock from his mouth hath faded, and the threat hath failed from his brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his face is as great and Godlike as his fathers of old days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fair as an image fashioned in remembrance of their praise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fled is the spirit of Hogni, and every deed he did,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seed of the world it lieth, in the hand of Odin hid.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On the gold is the heart of Hogni, and men bear it forth to the King,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lo, the heart of a son of Giuki! and Gunnar liveth yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the white unangry Gudrun by the Eastland King is set:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upriseth the soul of Atli, and his breast is swollen with pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he laughs in the face of Gunnar and the woman set by his side:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he looks on his living earls, and they cast their cry to the roof,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span><span class="i0">And it clangs o'er the woeful city and wails through the night aloof;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Though the men of the East in glory high-tide with Atli win.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But fair is the face of Gunnar as the token draweth anigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he saith: "O heart of Hogni, on the gold indeed dost thou lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as little as there thou quakest far less wert thou wont to quake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou lay'st in the breast of the mighty, and wert glad for his gladness' sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wert sorry with his sorrow; O mighty heart, farewell!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell for a little season, till thy latest deed I tell."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then was Gunnar silent a little, and the shout in the hall had died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he spoke as a man awakening, and turned on Atli's pride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou all-rich King of the Eastlands, e'en such a man might I be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I might utter a word, and the heart should be glad in thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I should live and be sorry; for I, I only am left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tell of the ransom of Odin, and the wealth from the toiler reft.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, once it lay in the water, hid, deep adown it lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the Gods were grieved and lacking, and men saw it and the day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let it lie in the water once more, let the Gods be rich and in peace!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I at least in the world from the words and the babble shall cease."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he spake and Atli beheld him, and before his eyes he shrank:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still deep of the cup of desire the mighty Atli drank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to overcome seemed little if the Gold he might not have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his hard heart craved for a while to hold the King for a slave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bondman blind and guarded in his glorious house and great:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he thought of the overbold, and of kings who have dallied with fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And died bemocked and smitten; and he deemed it worser than well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the last of the sons of Giuki hangeth back from his journey to Hell:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he turneth away from the stranger, and beholdeth Gudrun his wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not glad nor sorry by seeming, no stirrer nor stayer of strife:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he looked at his living earl-folk, and thought of his groves of war,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span><span class="i0">And his realm and the kindred nations, and his measureless guarded store:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Though the feeble folk go wailing? Then he cried aloud and said:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Why tarry ye, Sons of the Morning? the wain for the bondman is dight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the folk that are waiting his body have need of no sunshine to smite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go forth 'neath the stars and the night-wind; go forth by the cloud and the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And come back with the word in the dawning, that my house may be merry at noon!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the sword-folk rise round Gunnar, round the fettered and bound they throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As men in the bitter battle round the God-kin over-strong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They bore him away to the doorway, and the winds were awake in the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wood of the thorns of battle in the moon shone sharp and bright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Gunnar looked to the heavens, and blessed the promise of rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the windy drift of the clouds, and the dew on the builded wain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sword-folk tarried a little, and the sons of the wise were there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beheld his face o'er the war-helms, and the wavy night of his hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then they feared for the weal of Atli, and the Niblung's harp they brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they dealt with the thralls of the sword, and commanded and besought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till men loosened the gyves of Gunnar, and laid the harp by his side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the yoke-beasts lowed in the forecourt and the wheels of the waggon cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the war-thorns clashed in the night, and the men went dark on their way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the city was silent before them, on the roofs the white moon lay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now they left the gate and the highway, and came to a lonely place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the sun all day had been shining on the desert's empty face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the moon ran forth from a cloud, the grey light shone and showed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pit of King Atli's adders in the land without a road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Digged deep adown in the desert with shining walls and smooth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the Serpents' habitation, and the folk that know not ruth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therein they thrust King Gunnar, and he bare of his kingly weed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they gave his harp to the Niblung, and his hands of the gyves they freed;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span><span class="i0">They stood around in their war-gear to note what next should befall<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Still hot was that close with the sun, and thronged with the coiling folk,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But he heeded them not nor beheld them, and his hands in the harp-strings ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he sat him down in the midmost on a sun-scorched rock and wan:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he sighed as one who resteth on a flowery bank by the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the wind is in the blossoms at the even-tide of day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his harp was murmuring low, and he mused: Am I come to the death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, who was Gunnar the Niblung? nay, nay, how I draw my breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love my life as the living! and so I ever shall do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though wrack be loosed in the heavens and the world be fashioned anew.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Smooth coil, and flickering tongue, and eyes as the gold in the fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he looked and beheld them and spake, nor stilled his harp meanwhile:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What will ye? O thralls of Atli, O images of guile?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then, he rose at once to his feet, and smote the harp with his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it rang as if with a cry in the dream of a lonely land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he fondled its wail as it faded, and orderly over the strings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went the marvellous sound of its sweetness, like the march of Odin's kings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New-risen for play in the morning when o'er meadows of God-home they wend,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And I fought and was glad in the morning, and I sing in the night and the end:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So let him stand forth, the Accuser, and do on the death-shoon to wend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For not here on the earth shall I hearken, nor on earth for the dooming shall stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor stretch out mine hand for the pleading; for I see the spring of the day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round the doors of the golden Valhall, and I see the mighty arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I hearken the voice of Odin, and his mouth on Gunnar cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he nameth the Son of Giuki, and cries on deeds long done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the fathers of my fathers, and the sons of yore agone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O Odin, I see, and I hearken; but, lo thou, the bonds on my feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the walls of the wilderness round me, ere the light of thy land I meet!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I crave and I weary, Allfather, and long and dark is the road;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the feet of the mighty are weakened, and the back is bent with the load."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then fainted the song of Gunnar, and the harp from his hand fell down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he cried: "Ah, what hath betided? for cold the world hath grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cold is the heart within me, and my hand is heavy and strange;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What voice is the voice I hearken in the chill and the dusk and the change?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where art thou, God of the war-fain? for this is the death indeed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I unsworded, unshielded, in the Day of the Niblungs' Need!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He fell to the earth as he spake, and life left Gunnar the King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his heart was chilled for ever by the sleepless serpent's sting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grey Worm, Great and Ancient&mdash;and day in the East began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the moon was low in the heavens, and the light clouds over him ran.<br /></span>

<h4>The Ending of Gudrun.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Men sleep in the dwelling of Atli through the latter hours of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the comfortless women be wailing as they that love not light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men sleep in the dawning-hour, and bowed down is Atli's head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst the gold and the purple, and the pillows of his bed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hark, ere the sun's uprising, when folk see colours again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the trample of steeds in the fore-court, and the noise of steel and of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Atli wakeneth and riseth, and is clad in purple and pall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he goeth forth from the chamber and meeteth his earls in the hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A king full great and mighty, if a great king ever hath been;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over his head on the high-seat still sitteth Gudrun the Queen.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then he said: "Whence come ye, children? whence come ye, Lords of the East?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall today be for evil and mourning or a day of joyance and feast?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They said: "Today shall be wailing for the foes of the Eastland kin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for them that love King Atli shall the day of feasts begin:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we come from the land deserted, and the heath without a way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now are the earth's folk telling of the Niblungs passed away."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then King Atli turned unto Gudrun, and the new sun shone through the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long beams fell from the mountains and lighted Atli's floor:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he cried: "Lo, the day-light, Gudrun! and the Cloudy Folk is gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is glory now in the Eastland, and thy lord is king alone."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Gudrun rose from the high-seat, and her eyes on the King she turned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he stood rejoicing before her, and his crown in the sunlight burned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the golden gear was he swaddled, and he held the red-gold rod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the Kings of the East had carried since first they came from God:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down she came, and men kept silence, and the earls beheld her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As her raiment rustled about her in the morning-joyous place:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span><span class="i0">So she stood amidst of the sun-beams, by King Atli's board she stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men looked and wondered at her, would she speak them ill or good:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wept not, and she sighed not, nor smiled in the stranger land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she stood before King Atli, and the cup was in her hand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she spake: "Take, King, and drink it! for earth's mightiest men prevail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to thee is the praise and the glory, and the ending of the tale:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are men to the dead land faring, but the dark o'er their heads is deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They cry not, they return not, and no more renown they reap;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we do our will without them, nor fear their speech or frown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glad shall be our uprising, and light our lying-down."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She said: "A maid of maidens my mother reared me erst;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the side of the glorious Gunnar my early days were nursed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the side of the heart-wise Hogni I went from field to flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joy rose with the sun's uprising, nor sank in the twilight hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kings looked and laughed upon us as we played with the golden toy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft our hands were meeting as we mingled joy with joy."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">More she spake: "O King command me! for women's knees are weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their feet are little steadfast, and their hands for comfort seek:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the earth the blossom falleth when the branch is dried with day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the vine to the elm-bough clingeth when men smite the roots away."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then drank the Eastland Atli as he looked in Gudrun's face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beheld no wrath against him, and no hate of the coming days;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then he spake: "O mighty woman, this day the feast shall be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the heritance of Atli, and the gain of mine and me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this day the Eastland people such great dominion win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That a world to their will new-fashioned 'neath their glory shall begin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, since the mighty are fallen, and kings are gone from earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let these at the feast be remembered, and their ancient deeds of worth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I bid thee, O King's Daughter, sit by Atli at the feast,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span><span class="i0">To praise thy kin departed and Atli's weal increased;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the heirship-feast and the death-feast today shall be as one;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then shalt thou wake tomorrow with all thy mourning done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all thy will accomplished, and thy glory great and sure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That for ever and for ever shall the tale thereof endure."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He spake in the sunny morning, and Gudrun answered and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Thou hast bidden me feast, O Atli, and thy will shall be obeyed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well I thank thee, great-one, for the gifts thine hand would give;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For who shall gainsay the mighty, and the happy Kings that live?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hast swallowed the might of the Niblungs, and their glory lieth in thee:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live long, and cherish thy wealth, that the world may wonder and see!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Therewith to the bower of queens the Niblung wendeth her way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in all the glory of women the folk her body array:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth she comes with the crown on her head and the ivory rod in her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With queens for her waiting-women, and the hope of many a land:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There she goes in that wonder of houses when the high-tide of Atli is dight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her face is as fair as the sea, and her eyen are glittering bright.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By Atli's side she sitteth, o'er the earls they twain are set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shields of the ancient wise-ones on the wall are hanging yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the golden sun of the roof-sky, the sun of Atli's pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the beams where day but glimmers casts red light far and wide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beakers clash thereunder, the red wine murmureth speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the eager long-beard warriors cast praises each to each<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the blossoming tree of the Eastland:&mdash;and tomorrow shall be as today,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, even more abundant, and all foes have passed away.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was then in the noon-tide moment; o'er the earth high hung the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the song o'er the mighty Niblungs in a stranger-house was begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their deeds were told by the foemen, and the names of hope they had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang sweet in the hall of the murder to make King Atli glad:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span><span class="i0">It is little after the noon-tide when thereof they sing no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor tell of the strife that has been, and the leaping flames of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the vengeance lulled for ever and the wrath that shall never awake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For where is the kin of Hogni, and who liveth for Gunnar's sake?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So men in the hall make merry, nor note the afternoon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the time when men grow weary with the task that ends not soon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun falls down unnoted, and night and her daughter are nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a dull grey mist and awful hangeth over the east of the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spreadeth, though winds are sleeping, and riseth higher and higher;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the clouds hang high in the west as a sea of rippling fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the face of the gazer is lighted, if unto the west ye gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And white walls in the lonely meadows grow ruddy under the blaze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet brighter e'en than the cloud-sea, far-off and clear serene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mid purple clouds unlitten the light lift lieth between;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who looks, save the lonely shepherd on the brow of the houseless hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hath many a day seen no man to tell him of good or of ill?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Day dies, and the storm-threats perish, and the stars to the heaven are come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the white moon climbeth upward and hangs o'er the Eastland home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no man in the hall of King Atli shall heed the heavens without,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Atli's roof is their heaven, and thereto they cast the shout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this, the glory they builded, is become their God to praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hope of their generations, the giver of goodly days:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more they hearken the harp-strings, no more they hearken the song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All the might of the deedful Niblungs is a tale forgotten long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yester-morning's murder is as though it ne'er had been;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They heed not the white-armed Gudrun, the glorious Stranger-Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They heed not Atli triumphant, for they also, they are Kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are brethren of the God-folk and the fashioners of things;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, the Gods,&mdash;and the Gods have sorrow, and these shall rue no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These world-kings, these prevailers, these beaters-down of war:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What golden house shall hold them, what nightless shadowless heaven?<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span><span class="i0">&mdash;So they feast in the hall of Atli, and that eve is the first of the seven.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So they feast, and weary, and know not how weary they are grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they stretch out hands to gather where their hands have never sown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They are drunken with wine and with folly, and the hope they would bring to pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the mirth no man may compass, and the joy that never was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till their heads hang heavy with slumber, and their hands from the wine-cup fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blind stray their hands in the harp-strings and their mouths may tell no tale.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the throne of Atli is empty, low lieth the world-king's head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mid the woven gold and the purple, and the dreams of Atli's bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Gudrun lieth beside him as the true by the faithful and kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every foe is departed, and no fear is left behind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, lo, the rest of the night-tide for which all kings would long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all warriors of the people that have fought with fear and wrong.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet a while;&mdash;it was but an hour and the moon was hung so high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it seemed that the silent night-tide would never change and die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lo, how the dawn comes stealing o'er the mountains of the east,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dim grows Atli's roof-sun o'er yestereven's feast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dim yet in the treasure-houses lie the ancient heaps of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But slowly come the colours to the Dwarf-wrought rings of old:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet a while; and the day-light lingers: yea, yea, is it darker than erst?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath the day into night-tide drifted, the day by the twilight nursed?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In helms and shields of the ancient, and swords by dead kings borne?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have the heavens come down to Atli? Hath his house been lifted on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest the pride of the triumphing World-King should fade in the world and die?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lo, lo, in the hall of the Murder where the white-armed Gudrun stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloft by the kingly high-seat, and nought empty are her hands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the litten brand she beareth, and the grinded war-sword bare:<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span><span class="i0">Without the garth of King Atli; but within, a wavering cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolls, hiding the roof and the roof-sun; then she stirreth and crieth aloud:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Alone was I yestereven: and alone in the night I lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I thought on the ancient fathers, and longed for the dawning of day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I rose from the bed of the Eastlands; to the Holy Hearth I went;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo, how the brands were abiding the hand of mine intent!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I caught them up with wisdom, with care I bore them forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I laid them amidst of the treasures and dear things of uttermost worth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Neath the fair-dight benches I laid them and the carven work of the hall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was wise, as the handmaid arising ere the sun hath litten the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the brands on the hearth she lighteth that her work betimes she may win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That her hand may toil unchidden, and her day with praise begin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Begin, O day of Atli! O ancient sun, arise,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She spake; and the sun clomb over the Eastland mountains' rim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shone through the door of Atli and the smoky hall and dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the fire roared up against him, and the smoke-cloud rolled aloof,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And back and down from the timbers, and the carven work of the roof;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There the ancient trees were crackling as the red flames shot aloft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the heart of the gathering smoke-cloud; there the far-fetched hangings soft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gold and the sea-born purple, shrank up in a moment of space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the walls of Atli trembled, and the ancient golden place.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But the wine-drenched earls were awaking, and the sleep-dazed warriors stirred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the light of their dawning was dreadful; wild voice of the day they heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they knew not where they were gotten, and their hearts were smitten with dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they deemed that their house was fallen to the innermost place of the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hall for the traitors builded, the house of the changeless plain;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span><span class="i0">They cried, and their tongues were confounded, and none gave answer again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rushed, and came nowhither; each man beheld his foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smote as the hopeless and dying, nor brother brother might know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sons of one mother's sorrow in the fire-blast strove and smote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sword of the first-begotten was thrust in the father's throat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the father hewed at his stripling; the thrall at the war-king cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mocked the face of the mighty in that house of Atli's pride.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There Gudrun stood o'er the turmoil; there stood the Niblung child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the battle-horn is dreadful, as the winter wind is wild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So dread and shrill was her crying and the cry none heeded or heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she shook the sword in the Eastland, and spake the hidden word:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The brand for the flesh of the people, and the sword for the King of the world!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then adown the hall and the smoke-cloud the half-slaked torch she hurled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strode to the chamber of Atli, white-fluttering mid the smoke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But their eyen met in the doorway and he knew the hand and the stroke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shrank aback before her; and no hand might he upraise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was nought in his heart but anguish in that end of Atli's days.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But she towered aloft before him, and cried in Atli's home:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Lo, lo, the day-light, Atli, and the last foe overcome!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with all the might of the Niblungs she thrust him through and fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the flame was fleet behind her and hung o'er the face of the dead.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was none to hinder Gudrun, and the fire-blast scathed her nought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the ways of the Norns she wended, and her feet from the wrack they brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till free from the bane of the East-folk, the swift pursuing flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the uttermost wall of Atli and the side of the sea she came:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stood on the edge of the steep, and no child of man was there:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A light wind blew from the sea-flood and its waves were little and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave back no sign of the burning, as in twinkling haste they ran,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span><span class="i0">White-topped in the merry morning, to the walls and the havens of man.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then Gudrun girded her raiment, on the edge of the steep she stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She looked o'er the shoreless water, and cried out o'er the measureless flood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O Sea, I stand before thee; and I who was Sigurd's wife!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By his brightness unforgotten I bid thee deliver my life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the deeds and the longing of days, and the lack I have won of the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wrong amended by wrong, and the bitter wrong of my birth!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She hath spread out her arms as she spake it, and away from the earth she leapt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cut off her tide of returning; for the sea-waves over her swept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their will is her will henceforward; and who knoweth the deeps of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wealth of the bed of Gudrun, and the days that yet shall be?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ye have heard of Sigurd aforetime, how the foes of God he slew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How forth from the darksome desert the Gold of the Waters he drew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How he wakened Love on the Mountain, and wakened Brynhild the Bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dwelt upon Earth for a season, and shone in all men's sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye have heard of the Cloudy People, and the dimming of the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the latter world's confusion, and Sigurd gone away;<br /></span>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
